            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mbroſe</hi> in a certaine place ſaith nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <hi>There ought to be no ſtrife, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, among the ſervants of Christ.</hi> For, ſeeing the dulneſſe of mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, eſpecially in heavenly matters, is ſuch, that we cannot oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perceive matters otherwiſe very plain, it can by no means be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that by mutuall conference, and friendly, and brotherly debating of the matter, we come to very great light. And that eſpecially ſeemeth profitable and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that ſome ſhould be ſet on edge by others, that thoſe things which the Lord hath particularly beſtowed upon ſeverall members of the Church, may redound to the common benefit of the whole body, and that all ſiniſter affection ſet a part, Chriſt, who is the Fathers wiſdome, and the onely Maſter and Teacher of the Church may be
<pb facs="tcp:61072:3"/> heard: and as he is the Prince of peace may ſo by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit joyne together our minds, that if it be poſſible, we may all thinke one and the ſame thing in the Lord. But to ſtrive, braule, and fiercely, and frowardly to contend, as fenſers doe, is ſo farre from becoming men that are taught of God, as that it is not ſeemely for modeſt or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill perſons. And if ſo be that in all, yea even in the very leaſt affairs of mans life, that rule of modeſtie is to be kept, what, I pray you, is to be done, when we are in hand with God and Gods matters? Surely, holy things are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and devoutly to be handled, in the feare of God, and love of our neighbour. Who, if he goe out of the way, is by the ſpirit of meekneſſe to be called backe again: but if he take the right way, he is more and more to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted therein, to the end it may appeare, that we are not driven by any motion of man, but that in all things our mindes are ruled and governed by God. Yet alas, ſuch is the ſpot and ſtaine of our times, that the evill cuſtome of writing whatſoever, and even of railing, hath ſeiſed upon the wits, and mindes not of meane men onely, but even of thoſe, whom it moſt of all behooved to doe the cleane contrary. The rable of Ieſuits, and ſuch other like fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, (whoſe very reward is the earneſt of bondage and curſed ſpeaking) how ſhameleſly and outragiouſly they are carried againſt us and the truth: and with what bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe they caſt out againſt us ſuch things, as they have been taught in the ſchoole of ſhameleſneſſe, it may be ſufficiently perceived of any man.</p>
            <p>For they, when they feele themſelves preſſed with moſt ſtrong reaſons, and overcome with expreſſe places of Scripture, they run to cavils and ſlanders, as to the onely refuge of their errours. They ſay we have revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Catholique Church, that we might follow the divers imaginations of men: they cry aloud that we are heretiques, ſchiſmatiques, and ſectaries, and they oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:61072:3"/> in mockage call us Confeſſioniſts: and moreover they lay in our diſh, that we neither agree with our ſelves, nor with others, who deteſt the Biſhop of Rome: but there are as many Religions among us, as there are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Faith. And that they may ſeeme to procure credit to themſelves, and to give a checke to the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Churches eſpecially, they bring forth both cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other writings, and eſpecially that <hi>Forme</hi> of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of late publiſhed in Germanie, in which there are certaine things to be ſeene farre differing from thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Confeſſions of Faith, which the Churches of the Goſpell have even ſince the beginning given out. But let them ſo thinke, that the fault of hereſie is not to be laid upon thoſe, whoſe faith altogether relieth on moſt ſure grounds of Scripture: that they are no ſchiſmatiques, who intirely cleave to Gods Church, ſuch an one as the Prophets and Apoſtles doe deſcribe unto us: nor to be accounted ſectaries, who embrace the truth of God, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is one and alwaies like itſelfe. What do they meane, I pray you, by the name of Confeſſioniſts ſo often repeated? For if every man be commanded to make confeſſion of his Faith ſo often as Gods glory, and the edifying of the Church ſhall require; what a wonderfull or ſtrange thing ought it to ſeeme, if Cities, if Provinces, if whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes have made profeſſion of their Faith, when they were falſely charged by the Popiſh ſort, that they had gone from the doctrine of the true beleeving Church? but they wil ſay, there ought to be one confeſſion of faith and no moe: as though forſooth, a confeſſion of faith were to be valued rather by the words, then by the thing it ſelfe. What therefore will they ſay to our Anceſtours, who when they had the Apoſtles Creed, yet for all that ſet out the Nicene, Chalcedonian, and many moe ſuch like Creeds? Thoſe Creeds, ſay you, were generall. Yea ſurely, but ſo generall, that a great part of the world
<pb facs="tcp:61072:4"/> in thoſe elder times followed the frantique hereſies of the Arrians, whom the godly forefathers by ſetting forth thoſe Creeds deſired to bring home into the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. <hi>The truth,</hi> ſaith Hilarie, <hi>was by the adviſe and opinions of Biſhops many waies ſought, and a reaſon of that which was meant was rendered by ſeverall confeſsions of faith ſet down in writing:</hi> And a little after. <hi>It ought to ſeeme no marvell right well-beloved brethren, that mens faiths began to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſo thick: the outrage of heretiques layeth this neceſsitie upon us.</hi> Thus much ſaid <hi>Hilarie.</hi> What, that <hi>Athanaſius, Auguſtine,</hi> and many other ancients ſet forth their Creeds alſo, that the puritie of Chriſtian faith might more and more ſhine forth. Therefore if Kingdoms, Cities, and and whole Provinces have privately made confeſſion of their faith, this was the cauſe thereof, for that hitherto the ſtate of times hath not ſuffered, that a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of all thoſe, who profeſſe the reformed Religion, might be holden. But if it once come to paſſe (and the Lord grant that the Churches may at length injoy ſo great a benefit) then there may be one onely confeſſion of faith extant, conceived in the ſame words, if the ſtate of the Churches ſhall ſeeme to require it. Let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave of in mockage to terme us Confeſſioniſts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perhaps they looke for this anſwer at our hands, that it is a farre more excellent thing to beare a name of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the faith, then of denying the truth. For even as moe ſmall ſtreames may flow from one ſpring, ſo moe confeſſions of faith, may iſſue out from one and the ſame truth of faith.</p>
            <p>Now to ſpeake ſomewhat alſo of thoſe, who while they will ſeeme to embrace the truth of the Goſpell, and renounce popiſh errours, ſhew themſelves more unjuſt towards us, then was meet they ſhould, we are compelled to finde want of Chriſtian charitie in them. This one thing in deed was remaining, that after ſo many dangers,
<pb facs="tcp:61072:4"/> loſſes, baniſhments, down-fals, woes without number, griefs and torments, we ſhould alſo be evill intreated by thoſe, of whom ſome comfort was rather to be looked for. But that ancient enemie of the Church is farre decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (by whoſe ſubtilties this evill is alſo wrought for us) while he hopeth that we may by his crafts be overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But bearing our ſelves bold on that love, which the mercifull God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord beareth unto us, and who hath planted a love and feare of him in our mindes, we leap for joy in theſe very things, and boaſt with the Apoſtle, that it will never be, (the ſame grace of God alwaies preventing us) that tribulation, anguiſh, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nakedneſſe, the ſword, falſe accuſation, or curſed ſpeaking ſhall withdraw us from the truth once knowne and undertaken. For we know that ſaying of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> to be true, <hi>It is not evill, to ſuffer, but to doe evill.</hi> Neither are we any whit diſgraced hereby, but they whom I know not what diſtemperature whetteth againſt us having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved nothing, and to repay them like for like, quitting rayling with rayling, far be it from us, whom God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth this honour, that being faſhioned like to the image his Son we might through good report and evill report walke on, upholden with the ſtay of a good conſcience, yea we have reſolved with our ſelves not only to abide the open wrongs of our enemies, but even the diſdaine of our brethren, although never ſo unjuſt.</p>
            <p>And what we furthermore thinke of the doctrine of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the confeſſion of our faith, ſet forth many yeers agoe, hath made it known to the whole world: and we have God, and Angels, together with men, witneſſes of that ſincere endeavour, by which we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, and doe as yet, to the uttermoſt of our power, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſet up againe and maintaine the pure worſhip of God among us ont of Gods word.</p>
            <p>And, even as we ſhewed our ſelves to be ready at all
<pb facs="tcp:61072:5"/> times to render a reaſon of the hope that is in us: ſo we thought it a matter worth the pains, to make all men pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie to that bond which one our part is very ſtraight with the holy and truly Catholike Church of God, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Saint and ſound member thereof, that ſo farre as we can, we might deliver, partly our ſelves, partly the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches joyned with us from thoſe moſt grievous crimes, by which ſome mens ſpeeches and books are laid to our charge. And when we bethought our ſelves by what means it might beſt be done, this eſpecially for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time ſeemed a meet way unto us, which would give offence to no man, and might ſatisfie all that would yeeld unto reaſon, namely, to publiſh this <hi>Harmonie</hi> of confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby it might ſufficiently be underſtood, how falſely we are charged, as though we, that have rejected popiſh errors, agreed not at all among our ſelves. For (to begin with thoſe ſtout maintainers of the Romiſh tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, who will yet ſeeme to be defenders of the truth, this conference of confeſſions will plucke every viſard from their faces, when as it ſhall plainly appear, that all the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in theſe confeſſions of faith were in other ſundry words ſo laid down, that yet the ſame truth alwaies abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and there is none at all, or very little difference in the things themſelves. And how narrow muſt they needs perceive the bounds of that their Catholike Church to be, when it ſhall be openly known, that ſo many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, provinces, cities, peoples and nations profeſſing the truth of the Goſpel, doe with common conſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the abuſes and orders of the Romiſh Church? As for thoſe whom (without any deſert) it pleaſeth to count us among the Arrians and Turks, they ſhall ſee alſo how farre through the benefit of God we be from ſuch hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and wicked errours. And they alſo, who accuſe us of ſedition, ſhall perceive how reverently we thinke of the dignitie of Kings, and the Magiſtrates authoritie,
<pb facs="tcp:61072:5"/> and they to conclude that not being content with thoſe publike confeſſions of the Churches of Germanie, may by laying againſt us that forme of new agreement ſeeme worthily more and more to ſever themſelves from us, and who have alreadie very pithily been refuted by moſt learned writings, they alſo ſhall, if true agreement be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſought, be ſatisfied with this <hi>Harmony.</hi> For (that we may freely ſay as it is indeed) that long ranck of names ſealed and written at that booke is ſuch, that it ſeemeth rather to ſtand idly in the field, then to fight manfully.</p>
            <p>And if it had pleaſed us to follow this pollicie, wee might have ſet downe the names not of ſeven or eight thouſand meane men (moſt famous Princes and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excepted) of whom it may worthily be doubted, whether there ever were any ſuch, or what they were, but alſo the names of farre moe Churches. And this our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence had beene farre more commendable, namely, being beſtowed, not in wringing out and begging from village to village ſome hundreds of names, but in laying out the opinions of moſt gracious Kings, moſt renowned Princes, of noble nations, and peoples, of moſt mighty common-wealths and Cities: of which a great part hath not been uſed to diſpute in corners, or to trifle, but hath knowne theſe many yeeres how even unto blood to ſuffer many and grievous things for Gods truth ſake. But we know that the truth hath not it warrant from men, nor by men: it is ſimple, it will be ſimply publiſhed and taught. Therefore we are purpoſed for this time not to deale by any long diſputation with any man, but barely to open the meaning of the reformed Churches, to knit all the Churches of Chriſt together with one bond of brotherly love, to keepe peace with all men, and ſo farre as it ought to be done, to judge well of all men: yea and to intreat thoſe, who think ſomewhat too hardly of us, that if we diſagree from the Confeſſion of no Church
<pb facs="tcp:61072:6"/> that doth truely beleeve, they would themſelves alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to be of the ſame minde with us, and quietly, and ſoberly conferre with their brethren, of what things they ſhall think good, rather then themſelves to ſlander and give the adverſaries occaſion to rayle upon the Goſpel. But if they will not do it, let this publique and everlaſting monument witnes to all that come after, that we &amp; all of our ſide are and ſhall be free not only from the grievous reproches, with which we are undeſervedly laden, but alſo without blame of all the hurly burlies and diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have been hitherto, and that (which God forbid) are peradventure like to be more grievous, unleſſe it be ſpeedily prevented on both ſides.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing in this <hi>Harmonie</hi> we ſpeake not onely with our owne, but even with the mouth of all thoſe Nations, whoſe Confeſſions we have brought into one forme of one and the ſame doctrine; we hope it will come to paſſe that not ſo much the ſeveral names of the French, Belgia, and other Confeſſions ſhall hereafter be heard, as that one onely univerſall, ſimple, plaine, and abſolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all the Churches (ſpeaking as it were with one and the ſame tongue of <hi>Chanaan</hi>) ſhall be ſeene: and that they who were thought to be farre wide (as hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to not altogether without deſert by reaſon of over many mens private writings beene thought of us and the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Confeſſion of <hi>Auſpurge</hi>) if ſo be that men keep within the bounds of the Confeſſions, and all cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſophiſtrie be laid aſide, and as well faithfull as favourable expoſition be admitted, ſhall be thought very neerely to agree in all things. And this was the cauſe why we deſired to put the Confeſſion of <hi>Auſpurge,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo with that of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Wirtemberge,</hi> in this <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,</hi> that it might be the more eaſily kuowne, that both we agree with them in all particular points of faith, and that there are very few matters hanging in controverſie
<pb facs="tcp:61072:6"/> between us. For concerning that doubt about the Lords Supper, in the thing, and of the thing it ſelfe, there is no ſtrife, we differ in certaine adjuncts and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the thing. In the thing it ſelfe, I ſay, we agree: although as the gifts of God are divers, ſo ſome doe more plainely, ſome doe not ſo plainly, and perhaps not ſo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, utter that which they thinke. For we all acknowledge that the holy ſigns, have not a bare ſignification, but that by the ordinance of God they aſſure our conſciences that the things themſelves are as truly and certainly given of God to all that come, as the ſignes themſelves are given by Gods Miniſter. But this queſtion remaineth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the ſigne, ſo alſo the preſent thing it ſelfe be given to the body, or rather the preſent ſigne be given to the body, but the preſent thing given onely to the minde and faith: Againe, whether as both be given to all, ſo both be received of all, of ſome unto life, and of other ſome unto death. In like ſort, we all beleeve the true Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the true body and the true blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. The controverſie ſtandeth in the manner of communicating, but who may therefore of right think, that the holy unitie of the Churches is to be plucked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder? That they of our ſide were alwaies deſirous of peace and agreement, the hiſtory of the conference at <hi>Marpurge,</hi> and ſuch things as were afterward done in the yeere 1536. do ſufficiently witneſſe.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ſo often as there appeared any hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, it is cleare, that there was no other cauſe, but the importunitie of ſome certain men, why new and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den braules being raiſed, the matter could not come, or long continue in that agreement which was hoped for. For that we may let paſſe very many other things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the beginning it were openly known among al, that there was no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſie between us (no not ſo much as the very Papiſts excepted) in the opinion about
<pb facs="tcp:61072:7"/> worſhipping the myſterie of the holy Trinitie; loe, about the latter end, that unhappy monſter of Vbiquitie came forth, which if it be admitted, will quite overthrow the true doctrine of Chriſts perſon, and his Natures. Hence then come the diſtractions of Churches, hence come ſo deadly quarrellings. But ſeeing this whole matter hath been often handled by many learned men, it is no time for us to deale any farther therein. For it is ſufficient for us to ſhew in few words, that our men ſo farre as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, alwaies provided for the peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>Neither truely hath any man cauſe after the example of certain Moderators (ſuch as not long ſince have been) why he ſhould perſwade himſelfe that we would heare of this hotch-potch of opinions make a certaine medlie as it were of contrarie qualities. But we leave all things whole, that every one may ſo know his owne words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared with the ſayings of others, that he ſhall finde nothing forged, nothing taken away, nothing put to, or wreſted. And to conclude, the forme and drift of this whole work, if it be more narrowly viewed, ſhall not unworthily be judged a ſound body of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, framed and allowed by the writings, and as it were by a common councel of the godly Churches well nigh of all <hi>Europe.</hi> For here all the chiefe points of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, being diſcuſſed and approved, are by the publique authoritie of all the chiefe Nations in Chriſtendome with one conſent publiſhed and knit together: yet we muſt confeſſe, as we afore touched, that through the manifold and buſie braulings of private perſons, and gloſſes (as men commonly ſpeak) the matter was brought farre from the grounds thereof to things cleane beſides the purpoſe and impertinent. For firſt there beganne to be dealing onely about the Supper: then it came to Chriſts Aſcenſion and ſitting in heaven: and within a while after to the perſonall union of both his natures,
<pb facs="tcp:61072:7"/> and what ſtay will there be in the end? for many, (by all mens leave be it ſpoken) ſeeme to be delighted with this continuall ſtriving, that howſoever, and whatſoever it might coſt them, they might not be unknowne. But it becometh the Diſciples of Chriſt to ſeeke peace, and to deſpiſe glory. For as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>They that deſpiſe peace, and ſeeke after glorie, they loſe both peace and glory.</hi> Away therefore with thoſe ſpeeches, <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Cephas,</hi> and let that one ſaying be heard, I am Chriſts, I am the Churches.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething that may be miſliked, yet there are very many things that may well be liked: the ſame ground worke of faith abideth, let therefore the ſame love continue: and let us not thinke much to take them for brethren, whom God vouchſafeth to take for ſonnes: neither let us deſpiſe thoſe, for whom Chriſt deſpiſed him ſelfe. That thing is aſſuredly true, and very much liked of us, that nothing in holy doctrine is to be thought of ſmall importance: but rather that even in the leaſt points thereof a certaine faith and full aſſurance is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, flat contrary to the wavering of the Academikes: yet we cannot like of too too much peeviſhneſſe, through which ſome do ſtraight way upon very ſmall occaſion call their brethren heretikes, ſchiſmatikes, ungodly, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans: let theſe ſpeeches be thrown out againſt Atheiſts, Epicures Libertines, Arians, Anabaptiſts, &amp; ſuch like miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevous perſons, which deſire to have the Lords field ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed: but let us every day grow in faith &amp; love: and let us teach the flocks committed to our charge, to fear God, to hate vices, and follow after vertues, to denie the world and themſelves: obeying the commandement of our Lord and teacher Ieſus Chriſt, who biddeth us not to braule but to love each other. Whoſe example in governing the Church if we will follow, we ſhall raiſe up thoſe that are afflicted, take up thoſe that are falne, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort
<pb facs="tcp:61072:8"/> the feeble, waken the drowſie, and not negligently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Gods wrath againſt ſinnes, and ſhall draw out the ſword of the ſame word which is no blunt one againſt hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, wolves, dogs, ſwine, goates, and to conclude againſt all wicked ones which in our Churches mingle themſelves with the true ſheepe, and which cauſe the word of God to be evill ſpoken of. It were a farre better thing ſurely then that which ſome do, buſying the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their wit in making of certaine trifles, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth the knowledge of ſuch ſubtilties, may ſhake out of our mindes all conſcience. It was juſtly ſaid that the ſtrength of the Goſpel was weakened through the thorny ſubtilties of ſchoole-queſtions: and we through our way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſputations what elſe doe we, then cauſe that the authoritie thereof be not ſtrengthned, but rather weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and doe even ſtagger among the wicked. We reade it excellently written in <hi>Livie,</hi> a very grave writer, that <hi>not onely grudges, but alſo warres have an end, and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deadly foes become faithfull confederates, yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Citizens: and that by the ſame ſpeeches of the people of Rome, very bitter or cruell enmities have beene taken up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene men of great account.</hi> And that which theſe few words wrought with the heathen, ſhall not godlineſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God obtaine at the hands of Chriſtians, of Divines, and of Paſtours of Churches? yea of the travell of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diligently examining and conferring of this booke ſhall not be irkeſome, if upright and ſincere judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if not prejudicate opinions, but the love of one truth ſhall beare ſway in all mens hearts, it will ſhortly obtaine it. That old contention about the celebrating of Eaſter very hotly toſſed to and fro, for two hundred yeeres, or there about, betweene the Greeks and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, was long ſince by us thought worthy of laughter: but we muſt take good heed, leſt in a matter not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlike, we ſeeme to be wiſer then both, if ſo be that
<pb facs="tcp:61072:8"/> we deſire to have the Church whole, and not to leave it rent unto the poſteritie, and would have our ſelves be counted not fooliſh among men, and not ſtubborne in the ſight of God. There hath ſcarce been any age, which hath in ſuch ſort ſeene all Churches following altogether one thing in all points, ſo as there hath not alwaies been ſome difference, either in doctrine, or in ceremonies, or in manners: and yet were not Chriſtian Churches through the world therefore cut aſunder, unleſſe perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture then, when the Biſhop of Rome brake off all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and tyrannically injoyned to other Churches, not what ought to be done, but what himſelfe would have obſerved: but the Apoſtle did not ſo. <hi>Barnabas</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed departed from <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſurely for no trifle: and yet the one became not more enemie or ſtrange to the other, but the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, which had coupled them from the beginning, never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to be dis-joyned from them-ſelves. It is the faſhion of Romiſts to command, to enforce, to preſſe, to throw, out ourſings, and thunder excommunications up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heads of thoſe that whiſper never ſo little againſt them: but let us, according to the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, ſuffer, and gently admoniſh each other: that is, keeping the ground-work of faith, let us build love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it and let us joyntly repaire the wals of Sion lying in their ruines.</p>
            <p>It remaineth, that through the ſame Lord Chriſt we beſeech our reverent brethren in the Lord, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions publiſhed we ſet forth, that they take this our paines in good part: and ſuffer us to leane, as it were, to a certaine ſtay, to the common conſent of the reformed Churches, againſt the accuſations and reproches of the common adverſaries of the truth. But it had been to be wiſhed, that we might at once have ſet out all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
<pb facs="tcp:61072:9"/> of all the reformed Churches: but becauſe we had them not all, therefore we ſet out them onely, that were come to our hands, to which the reſt alſo, ſo farre as we ſuppoſe, may eaſily be drawne. And we alſo could have wiſhed, that the thing might have beene made common to all the reformed Churches. But when as the ſtate of our Churches ſeemed to force the matter, and that they could not abide any longer delay: the right well beloved brethren will pardon us, with whom by reaſon of the time we could not impart both the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi> it ſelfe, and the Obſervations, as alſo the intent of this whole Edition. Whereas moreover we have put to moe confeſſions of one and the ſame Nation, as of <hi>Auſpurge,</hi> and <hi>Saxonie,</hi> as alſo the former and latter of <hi>Helvetia,</hi> that was not done without cauſe: for beſides that one expoundeth another, we thought it good alſo hereby to ridde them from all ſuſpicion of inconſtancie and wavering in opinion, which the adverſaries are wont to catch at, by ſuch repetitions of Confeſſions.</p>
            <p>Yet why we would not adde ſome Confeſſions of the brethren of <hi>Bohemia</hi> often repeated, we will ſtraight way ſhew a cauſe: and we hope that our reaſon will eaſily be liked of them. And we have ſet downe every where two, yea &amp; in ſome places three Editions of Auſpurge, for this reſpect, leſt in this diverſitie we might ſeeme to have picked out that, which rather favoured our ſide, and to have utterly miſliked the other. Wherein notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have not every where followed the order of times, in which every of them came to light, but the coppie which we had in our hands printed at <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge</hi> 1572. with a double Edition. And we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it meet to paſſe over the Apologies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the Confeſſions (as of <hi>Auſpurge, Bohemia, Sueveland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>) as well that the worke might
<pb facs="tcp:61072:9"/> not grow to be exceeding bigge, as alſo that we might not ſeeme rather to increaſe diſputations and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, then to make an Harmonie of doctrine. And as for our Obſervations, our minde was to meet with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of ſophiſters, who we know well enough will take hold on the leaſt matters, that they may thereby ſet us on worke. Wherefore leſt they ſhould charge us to ſet out a diſcord rather then a concord of Confeſſions, we have added in the end very ſhort Obſervations, in which we lay open thoſe things which might ſeeme ſome what obſcurely ſpoken, and doe favourably and freely, giving them an interpretation, expound thoſe things, which either have, or ſeeme to have any ſhew of repugnancie. And we beſeech the brethren to beare with us therein, as the moſt diſtreſſed, and deſirous of the peace and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches among thoſe, who in theſe laſt times have imbraced the truth of the Goſpel. For God forbid, that we ſhould deſire to be counted Cenſurers of others, who are ready rather to be taught of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to be ſtrengthned in this race of truth, which is begun. We would therefore have them ſo to thinke, that theſe Obſervations are laid before them, that they may judge of them, and may, if they ſhall thinke it any where needfull, better and more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare their owne opinion, and in the meane while accept of our paines.</p>
            <p>YE therefore moſt gracious Kings, Dukes, Earles, Marqueſſes, moſt famous Barons, and noble Lords, ye Cities, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, ye moſt wiſe Paſtours, Doctors, and, to be ſhort, all Chriſtian people, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the truth of the Goſpel, be preſent in ſoules
<pb facs="tcp:61072:10"/> and bodies, ſuffer not the poiſon of diſcord to ſpread any farther: but kill this hurtfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and receive with a Chriſtian minde as is meet, and as is offered unto you this moſt ſure token and earneſt of the everlaſting friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the French and Belgian Churches with you, offered to you in the face of the whole world: that we being by a friendly league coupled together in Chriſt, may vanquiſh all Antichriſts, and may ſing that Hymne to the Lord our God, <hi>Behold, how good and joyfull a thing it is, brethren to dwell together in unitie.</hi>

            <head>AN ADMONITION TO THE GODLY AND GENTLE READER, TOUCHING THE Order and courſe of this whole HARMONIE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His whole <hi>Harmonie of Confeſſions</hi> (gentle Reader) is parted into 19. Sections, which we have taken ſometimes out of moe, ſometimes out of fewer Confeſſions in number, as each ſeemed every one in his owne place to handle one and the ſame matter or chiefe point of doctrine. But in rehearſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of every Confeſſion, becauſe we were to have regard of the order of things and doctrine, rather then either of the time, or worthineſſe of the Churches and Authours that wrote them, or other ſuch like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: therefore it ſeemed good without any envie or preiudice of other Confeſſions, either more ancient or more famous, to give the firſt place to the latter Confeſsion of <hi>Helvetia;</hi> both becauſe the order thereof ſeemed more fit, and the whole handling of doctrine more full and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient: and alſo becauſe that Confeſsion was publiquely approved and ſubſcribed unto by very many Churches of divers Nations. Farther upon this doe the reſt fitly follow, to wit, the former Confeſsion of <hi>Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and then all other, without any choiſe, indifferently, ſave that we had rather ioyne together the Confeſsions of Germany, then ſever them each from other, according to the argument of every Section. Yet we were inforced to put that Confeſsion of the foure Cities, as received ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what late, in the laſt place. Which order notwithſtanding if it ſhall not ſeeme fit and convenient to any, it may eaſily be altered in the ſecond Edition, as other Confeſsions alſo, if any ſuch beſides theſe ſhall be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, may in their due place be adioyned.</p>
            <p>To conclude, that the godly Reader may want nothing, and that no man may ſuſpect any thing to be taken away or added to any of thoſe Cofeſsions, we have here ſet downe the Articles or chiefe points in the order wherein they were firſt written, Which we deſire every man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably to interpret, and to enioy this our labour, rather ſeeking peace and agreement, then maliciouſly hunting after occaſions of diſſentions.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>That the holy Scriptures are</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>not of any private interpretation,</hi> therefore we do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all expoſitions: whereupon we do not acknowledge that which they call the meaning of the Church of Rome, for the true and naturall interpretation of the Scriptures, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth the Defenders of the Romane Church do ſtrive to force all men ſimply to receive: but we acknowledge that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scriptures for authenticall and proper, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from the Scriptures themſelves (that is, from the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61072:19"/> phraſe of that tongue in which they were written, they being alſo wayed according to the circumſtances, and expounded according to the proportion of places either like or unlike, or of moe and plainer) accordeth with the rule of faith and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and maketh notably for Gods glory and mans ſalvation. Wherefore we do not contemne the holy Treatiſes of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> agreeing with the Scriptures, from whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we do modeſtly diſſent, as they are deprehended to ſet down things meerely ſtrange, or altogether contrary to the ſame. Neither doe we thinke that we doe them any wrong in this matter, ſeeing that they all with one conſent will not have their writings matched with the Canonicall Scriptures, but bid us allow of them ſo farre forth, as they either agree with them, or diſagree, and bid us take thoſe things that agree, and leave thoſe that diſagree: and according to this order we doe account of the <hi>Decrees or Canons of Councels.</hi> Wherefore we ſuffer not our ſelves in controverſies about Religion or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith to be preſſed with the bare teſtimonies of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Decrees of Councels, much leſſe with <hi>received cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,</hi> or <hi>elſe with multitude of men being of one iudgement, or with preſcription of long time.</hi> Therefore in controverſies of religion or matters of faith, we cannot admit any other Iudge then God himſelf, pronouncing by the holy Scriptures, what is true, what is falſe, what is to be followed, or what to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So we do not reſt but in the judgements of ſpirituall men, drawn from the word of God. Certainly <hi>Ieremie</hi> and other Prophets did vehemently condemne the aſſemblies of Prieſts, gathered againſt the Law of God: and diligently forewarned us, that we ſhould not heare the Fathers or tread in their path, who walking in their own inventions, ſwarved from the Law<note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 18.</note> of God. We do likewiſe reject <hi>humane Traditions,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be ſet out with goodly titles, as though they were Divine and Apoſtolicall, by the lively voice of the Apoſtles, and delivered to the Church, as it were by the hands of Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call men, by meane of Biſhops ſucceeding in their roomes: yet being compared with the Scriptures, diſagree from them, and by that their diſagreement bewray themſelves in no wiſe to be Apoſtolicall. For as the Apoſtles did not diſagree among
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61072:19"/> themſelves in doctrine, ſo the Apoſtles Schollers did not ſet forth things contrary to the Apoſtles. Nay it were blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to avouch, that the Apoſtles by lively voice delivered things contrary to their writings. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth expreſſely, that he <hi>taught the ſame things in all Churches.</hi> And againe. <hi>We,</hi>

                  <p>FIrſt of all the Miniſters of our Churches teach with one conſent, concerning the holy Scripture of the new and old Teſtament (which is commonly called the Bible; and is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received and allowed of the Fathers, which are of beſt and ſoundeſt judgement) that it is true certaine, and worthy to be beleeved, whereunto no other humane writings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, or of what ſort ſoever they be, may be compared, but that, as mans writings, they muſt give place to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Firſt, becauſe it is inſpired and taught of the holy Ghoſt, and uttered by the mouth of holy men, written by them, and confirmed by heavenly and divine teſtimonies: which ſpirit alſo himſelfe openeth and diſcloſeth the meaning how it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61072:20"/> ought to be underſtood, and the truth of this Scripture in the Church, in what manner ſeemeth him beſt: eſpecially by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up and giving faithfull Miniſters, who are his choſen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. Of which ſpirit <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord ſpake by me, &amp; his word was in my tongue:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 22. 2 Pet. 1.</note> and Peter, <hi>For prophecie came not in old time by will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt:</hi> and<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. Rom. 15. Ioh. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul. The whole Scripture given by inſpiration of God, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, &amp;c.</hi> beſides, the Lord himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> And againe, <hi>Ye are deceived, not knowing the Scriptures,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat 22. Luk. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>neither doe ye underſtand the power of God.</hi> And, <hi>he opened the minds of his Diſciples, that they might underſtand the Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe it is a true and ſure teſtimony and a clear proofe of Gods favorable good will, which he hath revealed<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> concerning himſelfe, without which revelation of Scripture, there is no wholeſome knowledge, nor faith, nor acceſſe to God. For in this, ſuch things as are neceſſarie to doctrine, to diſcipline and government of the holy Church, for all and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perſons in the ordinary miniſterie of ſalvation (whence alſo ſpringeth true faith) in this I ſay, are all ſuch things fully, abſolutely, and ſo far forth, as is requiſite, as in a moſt excellent and moſt exquiſite worke of the Holy Ghoſt, comprehended and included, then which no Angel from heaven can bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more certaine, and if he ſhould bring any other thing, he ought not to be beleeved.</p>
                  <p>And this perſwaſion and beliefe concerning holy Scripture, namely that it is taught and inſpired of God, is the beginning and ground of our Chriſtian profeſſion, which taketh begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Word outwardly preached, as from an ordinary meane, ordained of God for this purpoſe. Wherefore every one ought very highly to eſteeme of the divine writings of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, reſolutely to beleeve them, and religiouſly to yeeld unto them in all things, diligently to reade them, to gather wholeſome doctrine out of them, and according to them ought every man to frame and order him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but eſpecially they, who after an holy manner are ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Church of God. For which cauſes in our Churches and meetings this holy Scripture is rehearſed to the hearers in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61072:21"/> the common and mother tongue which all underſtand, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially (according to the ancient cuſtome of the Church) thoſe portions of the Goſpels in Scripture, which are wont to be read on ſolemne holy dayes out of the Evangeliſts and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles writings, and are uſually called Goſpels and Epiſtles: out of which profitable and wholeſome doctrines, and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſermons are made to the people, as at all times occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and need requireth.

                  <p>We furthermore make a difference betweene the holy<note place="margin">Artic. 6.</note> bookes, and thoſe which they call Apocriphall: for ſo much as the Apocriphall may be read in the Church, and it is lawfull alſo ſo farre to gather inſtructions out of them, as they agree with the Canonicall bookes, but their authoritie, and certaintie is not ſuch, as that any doctrine touching faith or Chriſtian

For ſeeing it is forbidden that any one ſhould adde or detract any thing from the Word of God, thereby it is evident enough that this holy doctrine is perfect and abſolute in all points and parcels thereof: and therefore no other writings of men, although never ſo holy, no cuſtome, no multitude, no antiquitie, nor preſcription of times, nor perſonall ſucceſſion, nor any councels; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, no decrees or ordinances of men are to be matched or compared with theſe divine Scriptures and bare truth of God, for ſo much as Gods truth excelleth all things.

                     <p>OVt of this fountaine of holy Scripture, and Chriſtian inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, according to the true and ſound underſtanding and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61072:29"/> meaning of the holy Ghoſt, our men teach by faith to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and with the mouth to confeſſe, that the holy Trinitie, to wit God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Perſons: but in eſſence one onely true, alone, eternall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, and incomprehenſible God: of one equall indiviſible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſence, <hi>Of whom, through whom, and in whom are all things:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 11. Exod. 20.</note> who loveth and rewardeth righteouſneſſe and vertue, but hateth and puniſheth all iniquitie and ſinne. According to this faith men are taught, to acknowledge the wonderfull workes of God, and thoſe properties which are peculiar to each perſon of the holy Trinitie, and of the Divine Vnitie, and to acknowledge the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and infinite power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe of the one onely God: out of which alſo ariſeth and proceedeth the ſaving knowledge as well of the Eſſence, as of the will of God. One kind of workes or properties of the three perſons of the Godhead (by which they are diſcerned one from the other) are the inward, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and hypoſtaticall proprieties, which alwaies remaine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and are onely apprehended by the eyes of faith, and are theſe.</p>
                     <p>That the father, as the fountaine and wel-ſpring of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, from all eternitie begetteth the Sonne, equall to himſelfe, and that himſelfe remaineth not begotten, neither yet is he the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sonne, ſeeing he is a perſon begetting not begotten. The Sonne is begotten of the eternall. Father from all eternitie true God of God: and as he is a perſon, he is not the Father, but the Sonne begotten of the eſſence or nature of the Father, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiall with him: which Sonne in the fulneſſe of time, which he had before appointed for this purpoſe, himſelfe alone (as he is the Sonne) tooke unto him our nature of the bleſſed Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and united it into one perſon with the godhead, whereof we ſhall ſpeake afterward. But the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne, and ſo he is neither the Father, nor the Sonne, but a perſon diſtinct from them eternall; and the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love of the Father and of the Sonne, ſurpaſſing all admiration: theſe three perſons are one true God, as is aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>The other kind of workes in theſe perſons, and in the unitie of the godhead iſſueth as it were into open ſight out of the divine eſſence and the perſons thereof, in which being diſtinct they have manifeſted themſelves: and theſe are three. The firſt is the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull worke of Creation, which the Creeds doe attribute to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61072:30"/> Father. The ſecond is the worke of Redemption, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Chriſt. The third is the worke of Sanctification, which is aſcribed to the holy Ghoſt, for which cauſe he in the Apoſtles Creed is peculiarly called <hi>holy.</hi> And yet all theſe are the proper workes of one true God, and that of him alone, and none other: to wit, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt. This true and abſolute faith, and difficult knowledge of God, as well concerning his nature, as his will, is comprehended, and contained in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed Catholike and Apoſtolicall Creede, and in the decree of the Nicene Councell, agreeing therewith, and in many other ſound decrees, and alſo in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his confeſſion. All which we judge and profeſſe to be true. But it hath everlaſting and ſure grounds on which it relyeth, and moſt weightie reaſons, by which it is out of the holy Scripture convinced to be true: as by that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation wherein the whole Trinitie ſhewed it ſelfe, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Lord was baptized in Iordane: by the commandment<note place="margin">Matt. 3.

But much more clearely and plainly he afterward revealed himſelfe unto us in his holy and heavenly word, ſo far forth as it is expedient for his owne glory, and the ſalvation of his in this life.</p>
                  <p>According to this truth and word of God we beleeve in one onely God (who is one eſſence, truely diſtinguiſhed into three perſons from everlaſting by meane of the incommunicable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties) to wit, in the Father, in the Sonne, and in the holy Ghoſt. For the Father is the cauſe, fountaine, and beginning of all things viſible, and inviſible: the Sonne is the Word, wiſedome, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Father, the holy Ghoſt is the might and power which proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne. Yet ſo, that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction doth not make God as it were divided into three parts: ſeeing the Scripture teacheth, that the Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, have a diſtinct perſon or ſubſiſting in their properties, yet ſo, that theſe three perſons be one onely God. Therefore it is certaine, that neither the Father is the Sonne, nor the Sonne the Father, nor the holy Ghoſt either the Father, or the Sonne. Nevertheleſſe theſe perſons thus diſtinguiſhed, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divided, nor confounded, nor mingled. For neither the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor the holy Ghoſt have taken unto them mans nature, but the Sonne alone. The Father was never without his Sonne, nor without his holy Ghoſt, becauſe every one in one and the ſame eſſence is of the ſame eternitie. For none of theſe is either firſt or laſt, becauſe all three are one, both in truth and power, and alſo in goodneſſe and mercie.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61072:33"/>
                  <p>And all theſe things we know as well by the Teſtimonies of holy Scripture, as by the effects: and chiefly thoſe which we feele in our owne ſelves, and the teſtimonies of holy Scripture, which teach us to beleeve this holy Trinitie, are very common in the old Teſtament: which are not ſo much to be reckoned up, as with ſound judgement to be ſelected, ſuch as are in theſe: in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis</hi> God ſaith, <hi>Let us make man according to our Image and likeneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> and ſtraight after: <hi>Therefore God made man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne Image and likeneſſe, male, I ſay, and female created he them.</hi> Againe, <hi>Behold the man is become as one of us.</hi> For by that which is ſaid, <hi>Let us make man after our owne likeneſſe,</hi> it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there are more perſons in the godhead. But when it is ſaid, <hi>God created, &amp;c.</hi> the unitie of the godhead is ſignified. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not here expreſly ſet downe how many perſons there are, yet that which was obſcurely delivered in the old Teſtament, in the new is made clearer unto us then the noone day. For when our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was baptized in <hi>Iordan,</hi> the voyce of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was heard, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne:</hi> and the Sonne himſelfe was ſeen in the waters, and the holy Ghoſt appeared in the likeneſſe of a Dove. Therefore we are alſo commanded in the common baptiſme of all the faithfull to uſe this forme, <hi>Baptize ye all nations in the name of the Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Lo alſo in <hi>Luke,</hi> the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſpeaketh to <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of our Lord. <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the higheſt ſhall over ſhadow thee, therefore that holy thing which ſhall be borne of thee, ſhall be called the Sonne of God.</hi> In like manner, <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the fellowſhip of the holy Ghoſt be with you.</hi> Againe, <hi>There are three that beare witneſſe in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt, which three are one.</hi> By all which places we are fully taught, that in one onely God there are three perſons. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this doctrine paſſe all the reach of mans wit, yet we now ſtedfaſtly beleeve it out of the Word of God, looking when we ſhall enjoy the full knowledge thereof in heaven. The offices alſo and effects of theſe three perſons, which every of them ſheweth towards us, are to be marked. For the Father by reaſon of his power is called our Creator: the Sonne our Saviour and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe he hath redeemed us by his bloud: the holy Ghoſt is called our Sanctifier, becauſe he dwelleth in our hearts. And the true Church hath alwaies even from the Apoſtles age untill theſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61072:34"/> times kept this holy doctrine of the bleſſed Trinitie, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it againſt Iewes, Mahometanes, and other falſe Chriſtians, and hereticks, ſuch as were <hi>Marcion, Manes, Praxeas, Sabellius, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſatenus,</hi> and the like: all which were worthily condemned by the fathers of moſt ſound judgement. Therefore we doe here willingly admit thoſe three Creeds: namely that of the Apoſtles, of Nice, and <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and whatſoever things they, according to the meaning of thoſe Creeds, have ſet downe, concerning this point of doctrine.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve that Ieſus Chriſt in reſpect of his divine nature is<note place="margin">Artic. 10.</note> the onely Sonne of God, begotten from everlaſting, not made or created (for then he ſhould be a creature) but of the ſame eſſence with the Father, and coeternall with him: who alſo is the true Image of the Fathers ſubſtance, and the brightneſſe of his glory, in all things equall unto him. But he is the Sonne of God, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince the time he tooke upon him our nature, but from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, as theſe teſtimonies being laid together teach us. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, that <hi>God created the world:</hi> but Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>That all things were made by the word,</hi> which he calleth God: ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> avoucheth, that <hi>God made all things by his Son Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> It followeth therefore, that he who is called both God, and the Word, and the Sonne, and Ieſus Chriſt had his being even then, when all things were made by him. Therefore <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheah</hi> the Prophet ſaith, <hi>His going out hath beene from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from the dayes of eternitie:</hi> againe, <hi>He is without beginning of dayes, and without end of life.</hi> He is therefore that true God, eternall, Almightie, whom we pray unto, worſhip, and ſerve.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve alſo and confeſſe, that the holy Ghoſt proceedeth<note place="margin">Artic. 11.</note> from the Father and the Sonne from everlaſting, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but onely proceeding from them both, who is in order the third perſon of the Trinitie, of the ſame eſſence, glory and majeſtie with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne, and therefore he alſo is true and everlaſting God, as the holy Scriptures teach us.<note place="margin">Artic. 26.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We alſo beleeve that we have no acceſſe to God, but by that one onely Mediatour and Advocate Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, who was therefore made man (uniting the humanitie to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature) that there might be an entrance made for us miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men to the Majeſtie of God: which had otherwiſe been ſhut up againſt us for ever. Yet the Majeſtie and power of this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61072:34"/> (whom the Father had ſet between himſelf and us) ought in no caſe ſo much to fray us, that we ſhould therefore thinke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be ſought at our own pleaſure. For there is none either among the heauenly or earthly creatures, who doth more entirely love us then Chriſt himſelf, who when he was in the ſhape of God, humbled himſelf by taking upon him the ſhape of a ſervant, and for our ſakes became like unto his brethren in all points, and if we were to ſeeke an other Mediatour, who would vouchſafe us ſome good will, whom I pray you, could we finde, that would love us more earneſtly then he, who willingly laid his life downe for us, when as yet we were his enemies? If moreover we were to ſeeke another that excelleth both in ſoveraign authoritie and alſo power, who ever obtained ſo great power, as he himſelf, who ſitteth at the right hand of God the Father, and to whom all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is given in heaven and in earth? To conclude, who was more likely to be heard of God, then that onely begotten and dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son of God? therefore nothing but diſtruſt brought in this cuſtome, whereby we rather diſhonor the Saints (whom we think to honour) in doing theſe things, which they in their life time were ever ſo farre from doing, that they rather conſtantly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their dutie abhorred them, as their own writings beare witneſſe. Neither is our own unworthineſſe here to be alleadged for excuſe of ſo great ungodlineſſe. For we at no hand offer up our prayers truſting to our own worthineſſe, but reſting upon the only worthineſſe and excellencie of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe righteouſneſſe is ours by faith, whereupon the Apoſtle for good cauſe to exempt us from this vaine feare (or rather diſtruſt) ſaith, that Chriſt was in all things made like unto his brethren, that he might be a mercifull and faithfull high Prieſt in thoſe things that were to be done with God for the cleanſing of the peoples ſins. <hi>For in as much as he being tempted hath ſuffered, he is alſo able to help thoſe that are tempted.</hi> And that he might encourage us to come the more boldly to this high Prieſt, the ſame Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Having therefore a great high Prieſt, who hath entred the heavens, even Ieſus the Son of God, let us hold faſt this profeſſion. For we have not an high Prieſt that cannot be touched with the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our infirmities, but he was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſin. Let us therefore with boldneſſe approach unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercie and finde grace to help in time of need.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>we have libertie to enter into
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61072:35"/> the holy place through the blood of Ieſus. Let us therefore draw neer with a conſtant perſwaſion of faith, &amp;c,</hi> And againe, <hi>Chriſt hath an everlaſting Prieſthood. Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth, to make interceſſion for them.</hi> What need many words? when as Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>I am the way, the trueth, and the life. No man commeth to the father but by me.</hi> Why ſhould we ſeek unto our ſelves any other Advocate? eſpecially ſeeing it hath pleaſed God himſelf to give us his own ſon for our advocate, there is no cauſe why forſaking him we ſhould ſeek another, leſt by continuall ſeeking we never finde any other. For God undoubtedlie knew, when he gave him unto us, that we were miſerable ſinners. Whereupon it is, that according to Chriſts own commandement, we onely call upon the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, by the ſelf ſame Ieſus Chriſt our onely Mediatour, even as he himſelf alſo hath taught us in the Lords Prayer. For we are ſure that we ſhall obtaine all thoſe things, which we aske of the Father in his name.</p>

                     <p>INvocation is an honour, which is to be given onely to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, that is, to the eternall Father, and to his Son our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt, and to the holy Ghoſt. And God hath propoſed his Son Ieſus Chriſt for a Mediatour, and high Prieſt that maketh interceſſion for us. He teſtifieth, that for him alone our prayers are heard and accepted, according to that ſaying, <hi>Whatſoever you aske the Father in my name, he ſhall give it to you.</hi> Againe, <hi>There is one Mediatour betweene God and men.</hi> Therefore let them that call upon God offer up their prayers by the Son of God, as in the end of prayers it is accuſtomed to be ſaid in the Church, <hi>through Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe things are needfull to be taught concerning Invocation, as our men have elſe-where more at large written of Invocation. But contrariwiſe the cuſtome of invocating Saints that are departed out of this life is to be reprooved and quite throwne out of the Church, becauſe this cuſtome transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the glory due to God alone unto men, it aſcribeth unto the dead an Omnipotencie, in that Saints ſhould ſee the motions of mens hearts, yea it aſcribeth unto the dead the office of Chriſt the Mediatour, and without all doubt obſcureth the glory of Chriſt. Therefore we condemne the whole cuſtome of invocating Saints departed, and thinke it is to be avoided. Notwithſtanding it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth to recite the true Hiſtories of holy men, becauſe their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples doe profitably inſtruct, if they be rightly propounded. When we heare that <hi>Davids</hi> fall was forgiven him, faith is confirmed in us alſo. The conſtancie of the ancient Martyrs doth now like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtrengthen the mindes of the godly. For this uſe it is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the recite the Hiſtories. But yet there had need be diſcretion in applying examples.</p>

                     <p>COncerning the worſhip of Saints they teach, that it is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to propoſe the memory of Saints, that by their examples we may ſtrengthen our faith, and that we may follow their faith and good works, ſo farre as every mans calling requireth, as the Emperour may follow <hi>Davids</hi> example in making warre to beate backe the Turks, for either of them is a King: we ought alſo to give God thanks, that he hath propounded ſo many and glorious examples of his mercie in the Saints of his Church, and that he hath adorned his Church with moſt excellent gifts and vertues of holy men. The Saints themſelves alſo are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, who have holily uſed thoſe gifts which they employed to the beautifying of the Church: But the Scripture teacheth not to invocate Saints, or to aske help of Saints, but layeth onely Chriſt before us for a Mediatour, Propitiatour, high Prieſt and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour. Concerning him we have commandements and promiſes, that we invocate him, and ſhould be reſolved that our prayers are heard, when we flie to this high Prieſt and Interceſſour, as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, Chap. 16. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aske the Father in my name, he will give it you, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Iohn 14. Whatſoever ye ſhall aske in my name, that I will doe.</hi> Theſe teſtimonies bid us flie unto Chriſt, they command us to beleeve that Chriſt is the Interceſſour and Peace maker, they bid us truſt aſſuredly that we are heard of the Father for Chriſts ſake. But as touching the Saints, there are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commandements, nor promiſes, nor examples for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the Scriptures. And Chriſts office and honour is obſcured, when men flie to Saints, and take them for Mediatours, and invocate them, and frame unto themſelves an opinion, that the Saints are more gracious and ſo transferre the confidence due to Chriſt unto Saints. But <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is one Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and men.</hi> Therefore Chriſt eſpecially requireth this worſhip, that we ſhould beleeve that he is to be ſought unto, that he is the Interceſſour, for whoſe ſake we are ſure to be heard, &amp;c.</p>

Chapter of <hi>Eſay</hi> it is written, <hi>I am the Lord, this is my name, I will not give my glory to another:</hi> Invocation is a glory moſt properly belonging to God, as the Lord ſaith, Matth. 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> And it is an immooveable and eternall Decree of the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no ſtrange Gods.</hi> It is neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the doctrin touching Invocation ſhould be moſt purely upholden in the Church, for the corrupting of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the devill, even ſince the beginning of mankind, hath and will divers wayes ſcatter ſeeds. Wherefore we ought to be the more watchfull, and with greater care to reteine the manner of invocation or adoration ſet down in Gods word, according to that ſaying, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aske the Father in my name, he will do it.</hi> In theſe words there is an order eſtabliſhed, which we ought moſt conſtantly to maintaine, not to mingle therewith other means contrary to Gods word, or which are warranted by no example approoved in the Scriptures. There is no greater vertue, no comfort more effectuall, then true invocation. They therefore muſt needs be reprooved, who either neglect true invocation or corrupt it, as there be divers corruptions. Many doe not diſcerne their own invocation from that which is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61072:37"/> heatheniſh, neither indeed conſider what it is which they ſpeake unto. Of theſe the Lord ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> Chapter 4. <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what.</hi> He will have the Church to conſider whereto it ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>We worſhip that we know.</hi> Many conſider not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or wherefore they ſhall be heard. They recite prayers, and yet they doubt although it be written, <hi>Let him aske in faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering.</hi> Of theſe matters we will ſpeake elſe-where. In this place we reproove this heatheniſh corruption, whereby the cuſtome of thoſe that ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> upon men departed out of this life, is defended, and help or interceſſion is ſought for at their hands. Such invocation ſwarveth from God, and giveth unto creatures vertue, help, or interceſſion. For they that ſpeake ſome what modeſtly, ſpeake of interceſſion alone. But humane ſuperſtition goeth on farther, and giveth vertue to them, as many publike ſongs declare. <hi>O Mary Mother of grace, defend thou us from the enemie, and receive us in the houre of death.</hi> Theſe ſhort verſes have we heard a Monk of their divinitie ſay before one that lay a dying and often repeating them, wheras he made no mention of Chriſt: and many ſuch examples might be rehearſed.</p>
                  <p>There are yet alſo other brain-ſick opinions. Some are thought to be more gracious with ſuch or ſuch images: theſe frantike ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations ſeeing they are at the firſt ſight like heatheniſh conceits, doe undoubtedly both greatly provoke the wrath of God, and are to be reprooved by the Teachers, and ſharply to be puniſhed by Godly Magiſtrates, which reproofe containeth theſe three manifeſt reaſons: To aſcribe unto creatures omnipotencie, is impietie. Invocation of a creature, which is departed from the ſocietie of this life, aſcribeth unto it Omnipotencie, becauſe it is a confeſſion, that it beholdeth all mens hearts, and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the true ſighes thereof from feined and hypocriticall. Theſe are onely to be given to the eternall Father, to his Sonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; and to the holy Ghoſt. Invocation therefore is not to be made to men that are departed out of this life. It is to be lamented that theſe evils are not perceived: but looke to thy ſelfe, and weigh what thou doeſt: in this invocation thou forſakeſt God, and doeſt not conſider what thou doeſt invocate, and thou knoweſt that thoſe patrones which thou ſeekeſt, as <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Albeit we know what anſwer the Adverſaries make (for they have coyned cavils to delude the truth) yet Gods teſtimonies are wanting to their anſwer, and prayer which is without faith (that is, when thou canſt not be reſolved whether God allow and admit ſuch kinde of praying) is in vaine.</p>
                  <p>We remember that <hi>Luther</hi> often ſaid, that <hi>in the old Teſtament it is a cleare teſtimonie of the Meſſiah his Godhead, which affirmeth that he is to be invocated, and by this propertie is the Meſſias there diſtinguiſhed from other Prophets:</hi> he complained that that moſt weightie teſtimonie was obſcured and weakened by transferring prayer to other men. And for this onely cauſe he ſaid, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of praying to other was to be miſliked.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon is, Invocation is vaine without faith, and no worſhip is to be brought into the Church without Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: but there is no one ſentence to be ſeene, which ſheweth that this prayer made to men, which they maintaine, pleaſeth God, and is effectuall: the prayer therefore is vaine. For what kinde of praying is it, in this ſort to come unto <hi>Anne</hi> or <hi>George?</hi> I pray unto thee, but I doubt whether thy interceſſion do me good, I doubt whether thou heareſt me, or helpeſt me. If men underſtood theſe hid ſinnes, they woudl curſe ſuch kinde of prayers, as they are indeed to be curſed, and are heatheniſh. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward of ſuch faults what outrages enſue? flocking and praying to particular images, craving certaine benefits of every one; of <hi>Anne,</hi> riches are begged, as of <hi>Iuno,</hi> of <hi>George,</hi> conqueſts, as of <hi>Mars,</hi> of <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> freedome from the Plague, of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> ſavegard for ſwine, although the adverſaries ſay they like not theſe things, yet they keepe them ſtill for gaine ſake, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth.</p>
                  <p>Now let us adde the third reaſon: it is expreſſely written, <hi>there is one Mediatour betweene God and men, the man Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> on him ought we in all prayer to caſt our eyes, and to know the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel concerning him, that no man can come unto God but by confidence in the Mediatour, who together maketh requeſt for us, as himſelfe ſaith. <hi>No man cometh to the Father, but by the Sonne.</hi> And he biddeth us flie unto himſelfe, ſaying. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy loaden, and I will refreſh you:</hi> and he himſelfe teacheth the manner of Invocation, when he ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aske the Father in my name, he will give it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61072:38"/> you.</hi> He nameth the Father, that thou mayeſt diſtinguiſh thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation from heatheniſh, and conſider what thou ſpeakeſt unto: that thou maiſt conſider him to be the true God, who by ſending his Sonne, hath revealed himſelfe, that thy minde may not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the heatheniſh woman in the tragedy ſpeaketh, <hi>I pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto thee, O God, whatſoever thou art, &amp;c.</hi> But that thou maiſt know him to be the true God, who by the ſending, crucifying, and and raiſing up again of his Son hath revealed himſelfe, and maieſt know him to be ſuch a one as he hath revealed himſelfe. Secondly, that thou mayeſt know, that he doth ſo for a certaintie receive and heare us, making our prayers when we flie to his Sonne the Mediatour, crucified and raiſed up againe for us, and deſire that for his ſake we may be received, heard, helped, and ſaved, neither is any man received or heard of God by any other meanes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the praying uncertaine, but he biddeth thoſe that pray on this ſort to be reſolved through a ſtrong faith, that this worſhip pleaſeth God, and that they who pray on this manner are aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received and heard: therefore he ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aske in my name,</hi> that is, acknowledging, and naming or calling upon me as the Redeemer, high Prieſt, and Interceſſour: this high Prieſt alone goeth into the holieſt place, that is, into the ſecret counſell of the Deitie, and ſeeth the minde of the eternall Father, and maketh requeſt for us, and ſearching our hearts preſenteth our ſorrowes, ſighes, and prayers unto him.</p>
                  <p>It is plaine that this doctrine of the Mediatour was obſcured and corrupted, when men went to the Mother Virgin, as more mercifull, and others ſought other Mediatours, And it is plaine that there is no example to be ſeen in the Prophets or Apoſtles, where prayer is made unto men, heare me <hi>Abraham,</hi> or heare me O God for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake: but prayer is made unto God, who hath revealed himſelfe, to wit, to the eternall Father, to the Sonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to the holy Ghoſt, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, heare and ſave us for the Sonnes ſake. It is alſo expreſſely made to the Son, as 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2 Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, and God and our Father, who hath loved us, ſtrengthen you, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Gen. 48. Iacob</hi> nameth God, and the Sonne the Mediatour, when he ſaith, <hi>God before whom my fathers walked, and the Angel that delivered me out of all troubles</hi> (that is the promiſed Saviour) <hi>bleſſe theſe children.</hi> Therefore we uſe theſe formes of Invocation. I call upon thee O Almighty God, eternall Father of our Lord Ieſus
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61072:38"/> Chriſt, maker of heaven an earth, together with thy Sonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and thy holy Spirit, O wiſe, true, good, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, moſt free, chaſte, and mercifull God, have mercy upon me, and for Ieſus Chriſts ſake, thy Sonne, crucified for us, and raiſed up againe, heare and ſanctifie me with thy holy Spirit. I call upon thee O Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne of God, crucified for us, and raiſed up againe: have mercy on me, pray for me unto the everlaſting Father, and ſanctifie me with thy holy Spirit. In theſe formes we know what we pray unto. And ſeeing there are teſtimonies of Gods word to be ſeene, which ſhew that this praying pleaſeth God, and is heard, ſuch praying may be made in faith. Theſe things are not to be found in that invocation which is made unto men. Some gather teſtimonies out of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and others, to ſhew that the Saints in heaven have care of humane affaires. This may more plainly be ſhewed by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talking with Chriſt. And there is no doubt but that ſuch as are in happineſſe pray for the Church, but yet it followeth not thereupon that they are to be prayed unto.</p>
                  <p>And albeit we teach that men are not to be prayed unto, yet we propound the hiſtories of thoſe that are in bleſſed ſtate unto the people. Becauſe it is neceſſary that the hiſtory of the Church be by ſome meanes known unto all, by what teſtimonies the Church is called together and founded, and how it is preſerved, and what kinde of doctrine hath beene publiſhed by the fathers, Prophets, Apoſtles, and Martyrs. In theſe hiſtories we command all to give thankes unto God, for that he hath revealed himſelfe, that he hath gathered together his Church by his Son, that he hath delivered this doctrine unto us, and hath ſent teachers, and hath ſhewed in them the witneſſes of himſelfe: we command all to conſider of this doctrine, and to ſtrengthen their faith by thoſe teſtimonies, which God hath ſhewed in them. That they like wiſe conſider the examples of judgement and puniſhments, that the feare of God may be ſtirred up in them: we command them to follow their faith, patience, and other vertues, that they learne that in God is no reſpect of perſons, and deſire to have themſelves alſo received, heard, governed, ſaved, and helped, as God received <hi>David, Manaſſes, Magdalene,</hi> the <hi>thiefe</hi> on the Croſſe. We alſo teach how theſe examples are to be followed of every man in his vocation: becauſe error in imitation, and prepoſterous zeale is oft times the cauſe of great evils. We alſo commend the diligence
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61072:39"/> of the Saints themſelves, who took heed of <note n="*" place="margin">De eſſuſione S p ſancti, vide obſervat. 1. ad hanc Confeſſ.

                     <p>THere is no doubt but the memorie of thoſe Saints, who when they were in this bodily life furthered the Church either by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61072:39"/> doctrine or writings, or by miracles, or by examples, and have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther witneſſed the truth of the Goſpel by Martyrdome, or by a quiet kinde of death fallen on ſleepe in Chriſt, ought to be ſacred with all the godly: and they are to be commended to the Church, that by their doctrine and examples, we may be ſtrengthned in true faith, and inflamed to follow true godlineſſe.</p>
                     <p>We confeſſe alſo, that the Saints in heaven doe after their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manner pray for us before God, as the Angels alſo are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">* <hi>Vide obſerv. 1. ad confeſſ. Saxon. ſect. 1.</hi>

But as the worſhip of invocation of creatures is not to be inſtituted upon their groanings, ſo upon the prayer of Saints in heaven, we may not allow the invocation of Saints. For touching the invocating of them, there is no commandement, nor exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the holy Scriptures. For ſeeing all hope of our ſalvation is to be put, not in the Saints, but in our Lord God alone, through his Sonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, it is cleare, that not the Saints, but God alone is to be prayed unto. <hi>How ſhall they call on him,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, in whom they beleeve not?</hi> but we muſt not beleeve in the Saints: how then ſhall we pray unto them?

                     <p>But we, ſay they, worſhip not the Saints, but onely deſire to be holpen afore God by their prayers.

But this Majeſty agreeth to God alone, and if it be given to the creature, the creature is worſhipped.</p>
                     <p>Some men faine that the Saints ſee in Gods Word, what things God promiſeth, and what things ſeeme profitable for us: which thing although it be not impoſſible to the Majeſtie of God, yet <hi>Eſay</hi> plainly avoucheth. <hi>That Abraham knoweth us not, and Iſrael is ignorant of us:</hi> where the ordinary gloſſe citeth <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> ſaying, <hi>that the dead, even Saints, know not what the living doe, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For that the ancient writers often times in their prayers turne themſelves to Saints, they either ſimply without exact judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followed the errour of the common people, or uſed ſuch manner of ſpeaking, not as divine honour, but as a figure of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, which they call <hi>Proſopopaeia:</hi> Whereby godly and learned men doe not meane that they worſhip and pray to Saints, but doe ſet out the unſpeakable groaning of the Saints, and of all creatures, for our ſalvation: and ſignifie that the godly prayers, which Saints through the holy Ghoſt powred out in this world before God, doe as yet ring in Gods eares, as alſo the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> after his death ſtill cried before God: and in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the ſoules of the Saints that were killed cry, that their bloud may be revenged: not that they now reſting in the Lord, are deſirous of revenge, after the manner of men, but becauſe the Lord even after their death, is mindefull of the prayers, which while they yet lived on earth, they powred out of their own and the whole Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61072:41"/> that he will never deny us any of thoſe things, which we by a true faith aske of him through his Sonne. And ſeeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe ſetteth before us <hi>one onely Mediatour between God and men, to wit, the man Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. who both loveth us more entirely, and can by authoritie doe more with the Father then any other, they rightly thinke, that this onely interceſſour and advocate ought to ſuffice us. Yet they doe therewithall teach, that the moſt holy mother of God and Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Saints, are with great diligence to be honoured. But that that thing cannot otherwiſe be done, then if we ſtudie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in thoſe things, to which they eſpecially gave themſelves (namely, to innocencie and ſanctification,) and of which they ſet before us ſo worthy examples. For ſith they with all their heart and ſoule, and with all their ſtrength doe love God, we can in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleaſe them better, then if we alſo with them love God from the heart, and by all meanes poſſible to make our ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to him, ſo farre off are they from aſcribing their owne ſalvation to their merits: how therefore ſhould they preſume to help any other with their merits?

                     <p>AS touching Images, our Preachers reproved this eſpecially out of the holy Scriptures, that adoring and invocating of of them is ſo openly granted to the ſimple people againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement of God. Secondly, that ſo great coſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed for their worſhip and ornament: by which rather the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, thirſty, naked, fatherleſſe, ſick, and thoſe that are in bonds for Chriſt, ought to have been relieved. Laſtly, becauſe the moſt part are ſo perſwaded, that with ſuch worſhip and coſt beſtowed upon
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61072:41"/> Images, (both which things God abhorreth) they deſerve much at Gods hands, and that they obtaine ſpeciall helpe by this means. Contrariwiſe the ſame men doe teach, that the ancient writers (ſo long as Chriſtian faith remained ſome what pure) underſtood the Scriptures, which forbid worſhipping and praying to Images, in this ſenſe, that they thought it an abominable thing to admit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Images, either graven or painted, in the Church, although they were not otherwiſe ignorant, what our liberty is, as in all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things, ſo likewiſe in Images. For they nothing doubted but that it was flat contrary both to the commandements of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and alſo to the holy religion.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61072:42"/> of old in the Church of Chriſt, and brought in by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Whereas ſome ſay further, that <hi>Images be profitable for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Lay people,</hi> it appeareth firſt of all, that almoſt all Images were ſet up for pompe and ſuperſtition rather then for any other uſe. Secondly, neither is that reaſon very ſound. For although the Lord would inſtruct and bring to the knowledge of his goodneſſe the Iewes (farre more dull then becometh Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be) by divers outward ceremonies and pedagogies, yet he was ſo farre from thinking that the uſe of Images, was fit and convenient for that purpoſe, that he did even by name forbid it unto them. For whoſoever is not inſtructed and ſtirred up to the worſhip of God by the word of God, and by ſo excellent workes of his (which he layeth before us both in heaven and earth, and which are continually before our eyes and at hand, and which to conclude we ſo plentifully enjoy) ſurely the forme of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures altered by mans cunning, and ſo ſhapen, that ſtones, trees, mettals, and other like matter doe no longer detain their own ſhape, ſuch as they received it of God, but carry the countenance either of men or of beaſts, or of other things, will doe him no good. Yea it is certaine, that by the workmanſhip of ſuch Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges men are more withdrawne from the view of Gods workes to their owne workes, or to mens inventions: ſo that they doe not every where thinke alike of God, but keepe in religious cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations untill ſuch time as they light upon ſome Image. But ſurely if a man marke it well, the heaven and the earth, and whatſoever is contained in them, are excellent and worthy Images of God.</p>
                     <p>The heathens alſo uſed a pretence of inſtruction and teaching, to maintaine their Idols, but the holy fathers reſted not in ſuch excuſes. (Of which matter <hi>Lactantius</hi> teacheth at large in his ſecond booke of Inſtitut.) Neither could the heathens better abide to be upbraided for that they worſhipped ſtones, and ſtocks, then can the men of our age, as they which oftentimes confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that they tooke the Images to be nothing elſe but Images: and that they ſought nothing elſe, but to be Inſtructed and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by them.</p>
                     <p>And theſe things doth <hi>Athanaſius</hi> controll in theſe words: <hi>Goe to, let them tell me how God is known by Images, that is, whether it be for the matter whereof they conſiſt or for the forme imprinted in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61072:42"/> that matter. If the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>e the turne, what need is there I pray you of the forme? For God himſelfe ſhineth forth even in the matter, before that any thing be framed thereof by mans hands, for all things ſhew forth Gods glory. But if the forme it ſelfe, which is fitted to the matter, giveth occaſion to know. God what neede ſuch Images? might not God be knowne farre more excellently by the things themſelves, whereof Images be made? ſurely the glory of God might much more viſibly be ſeene, by the living creatures themſelves, either reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or unreaſonable, ſet before our eyes, then by dead Images which cannot move.</hi> And if any man ſhall ſay, theſe things might well be brought againſt Images, by which men thinke they may come to the knowledge of God, but we are to thinke otherwiſe of the Images of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and other Saints. Let him in like ſort thinke that God did many externall workes in Iſrael, of which he commandeth them to be mindefull for ever: and that he raiſed up unto them not a few famous and holy men, whoſe faith he would never have them to forget. Yet he never eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the memoriall of them by ſuch Images: that he might give no occaſion of backſliding or Apoſtaſie, which is wont to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the worſhipping of Images. Wherefore in the purer Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church it was abomination to have even the Image of Chriſt, as hath beene afore ſhewed. To be ſhort, our Preachers confeſſe that Images of themſelves are indifferent, ſo that no worſhip or adoration be done unto them. But it is not enough for a Chriſtian man to have a thing free, but he ought alwaies to have a diligent reſpect hereunto, whether the ſame be profitable for edification. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. for nothing is to be ſuffered or aſſayed in the Church, which hath not in it ſome certaine uſe of edifying.

For God had expreſſely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Cherubins to be made, but he would not have them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61072:43"/> ſeene of the people. And all the other things were ordained ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the beautie of the Temple, then to learne any knowledge of God thereby: although from them (as from all the reſt of Gods workes) they which were ſpirituall, might take occaſion to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon the goodneſſe of God. But it is requiſite alſo to call this to minde, that we are much more bound to worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth then they of old time were: for that we are more plentifully inriched with Chriſts ſpirit, if we truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him.</p>

                     <p>VVE beleeve that the Father by his word, that is, by the Son, made heaven, earth, and all other creatures of nothing, when he ſaw it fit and convenient, and gave to every one his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forme, and divers offices, that they might ſerve their Creator, and that he doth now cheriſh, uphold, and governe them all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61072:46"/> to his everlaſting providence and infinite power: and that to this end, that they might ſerve man, and man might ſerve his God. He alſo made the Angels, all good by nature that they might be his Miniſters, and might alſo attend upon the Elect: of which notwithſtanding ſome fell from that excellent nature in which God had created them, into everlaſting deſtruction: but ſome by the ſingular grace of God abode in the firſt State of theirs: but the Devils and thoſe wicked ſpirits, are ſo corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, that they be ſworn enemies to good and all goodneſſe, which as theeves out of a watch tower lye in waite for the Church and all the members thereof, that by their juglings and deceits they may deſtroy and lay waſte all things. Therefore being through their own malice addicted to everlaſting condemnation, they look every day for the dreadfull puniſhments of their miſchiefs. We therefore in this place reject the errour of the Saduces, who deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there were any ſpirits or Angels, as alſo the errour of the Manichees, who hold that the Devils have their beginning of themſelves, and of their own nature evill, and not corrupted by wilfull diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>We beleeve that this moſt gracious and mightie God, after he had made all things, left them not to be ruled after the will of chance or fortune, but himſelfe doth ſo continually rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne them, according to the preſcript rule of his holy will, that nothing can happen in this world without his Decree and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and yet God cannot be ſaid to be either the author, or guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the evils that happen in this world. For both his infinite and incomprehenſible power and goodneſſe ſtretcheth ſo farre, that even then he decreeth and executeth his works and deeds juſtly and holily, when as both the devill and the wicked doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly. And whatſoever things he doth paſſing the reach of mans capacitie, we will not curiouſly and above our capacitie inquire into them: Nay, rather we humbly and reverently adore the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, yet juſt judgements of God. For it ſufficeth us (as being Chriſts Diſciples) to learne onely thoſe things which he himſelf teacheth in his word, neither doe we thinke it lawfull to paſſe theſe bounds. And this doctrin affordeth us exceeding great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. For by it we know that nothing befalleth us by chance, but all by the will of our heavenly Father, who watcheth over us with a Fatherly care indeed, having all things in ſubjection to himſelf, ſo that not a haire of our head (which are every one numbred) can
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61072:47"/> be plucked away, nor the leaſt ſparrow light on the ground, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will of our Father. In theſe things therefore do we whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt, acknowledging that God holdeth the Devils and all our enemies ſo bridled as it were with ſnaffles, that without his will and good leave they are not able to hurt any of us: and in this place we reject the deteſtable opinion of the Epicures, who fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned God to be idle, to doe nothing, and to commit all things to chance.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>VVE teach in this matter, which at all times hath been the cauſe of many conflicts in the Church, that there is a triple condition or eſtate of man to be conſidered. Firſt, what man was before his fall, to wit, upright and free, who might both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in goodneſſe, and decline to evill: but he declined to evill, and hath wrapped both himſelf and all mankinde in ſin and death, as hath been ſhewed before. Secondly, we are to conſider, what man was after his fall. His underſtanding indeed was not taken from him, neither was he deprived of will, and altogether chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a ſtone or ſtocke. Nevertheleſſe, theſe things are ſo alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in man, that they are not able to doe that now, which they could not doe before his fall. For his underſtanding is darkned, and his will which before was free, is now become a ſervile will; for it ſerveth ſin, not nilling, but willing: for it is called a will, and not a nilling. Therefore as touching evill or ſin, man doth evill, not compelled either by God or the Devill, but of his own accord: and in this reſpect he hath a moſt free will: but whereas we ſee, that often times the moſt evill deeds and counſels of man are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61072:48"/> by God, that they cannot attain to their end, this doth not take from man libertie in evill, but God by his power doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that, which man otherwiſe purpoſed freely: as, <hi>Ioſephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren did freely purpoſe to ſlay <hi>Joſeph:</hi> but they were not able to doe it, becauſe it ſeemed otherwiſe good to God in his ſecret counſell. But as touching goodneſſe and vertues, mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth not of it ſelf judge aright of heavenly things. For the Evangelicall and Apoſtolike Scripture requireth regeneration of every one of us that will be ſaved. Wherefore our firſt birth by <hi>Adam</hi> doth nothing profit us to ſalvation. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The naturall</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2 Cor. 3.</note>

Therefore man not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate hath no free will to good, no ſtrength to performe that which is good. The Lord ſaith in the Goſpel, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> 
                        <hi>unto you, that every one that committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The wiſdome of the fleſh is enmitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi>

                        <hi>God. For it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Furthermore, there is ſome underſtanding of earthly things remaining in man after his Fall. For God hath of mercie left him wit, though much differing from that which was in him before his fall, God commandeth us to garniſh our wit, and therewithall he giveth gifts and alſo the increaſe thereof. And it is a cleare caſe, that we can profit very little in all Arts without the bleſſing of God. The Scripture doubtleſſe referreth all Arts to God. Yea and the Ethnicks alſo did aſcribe the beginnings of Arts to the Gods, as to the Authors thereof.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we are to conſider, whether the regenerate have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and how farre forth they have it. In regeneration the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is illuminated by the holy Ghoſt, that it may underſtand both the myſteries and will of God.

                        <hi>Chriſt not onely to beleeve in him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> And<note place="margin">Phil. 1. Phil 2.</note> again, <hi>I am perſwaded that he that began this good worke in you, will perform it untill the day of the Lord Ieſus:</hi> Alſo, <hi>It is God that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you the will and the deed.</hi> Where nevertheleſſe we teach, that there are two things to be obſerved: Firſt, that the regenerate, in the choice and working of that which is good, do not onely work paſſively, but actively. For they are mooved of God, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may do that which they do. And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth truly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge that ſaying, that <hi>God is ſaid to be our helper. For no man can be helped, but he, that doth ſomewhat.</hi> The Manichees did bereeve man of all action, and made him like a ſtone and a block.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that in the regenerate there remaineth infirmitie. For ſeeing that ſind welleth in us, and that fleſh in the regenerate ſtriveth againſt the ſpirit, even to our lives end, they do not readily performe in every point that which they had purpoſed. Theſe things are confirmed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 7. Gal.</hi> 5. Therefore, our free-will is weake, by reaſon of the reliques of the old <hi>Adam</hi> remaining in us ſo long as we live, and of the humane corruption, which ſo neerely cleaveth to them. In the meane while becauſe that the ſtrength of the fleſh and reliques of the old man are not of ſuch great force that they can wholly quench the work of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, therefore the faithfull are called free, yet ſo, that they doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their infirmitie, and glory no whit at all of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will. For that which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth repeat ſo often out of the Apoſtle, ought alwaies to be kept in minde by the faithfull: <hi>What haſt thou, that thou haſt not received? and if thou haſt received it, why doeſt thou boaſt, as though thou hadſt not received it?</hi> Hitherto may be added, that that commeth not ſtraight way to paſſe, which we have purpoſed. For the events of things are in the hand of God. For which cauſe <hi>Paul, Beſought the Lord that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>his iourney.</hi> Wherefore in this reſpect alſo free-will is very weak. But in outward things no man denieth but that both the regenerate and unregenerate have their free-wil. For man hath this conſtitution common with other creatures (to whom he is not inferiour) to will ſome things, and to nill other things. So he may ſpeake, or keep ſilence, go out of his houſe or abide within. Although herein alſo Gods power is evermore to be marked,<note place="margin">Numb. 24. Luke 1.</note> which brought to paſſe that <hi>Balaam</hi> could not go ſo farre as he would, and that <hi>Zacharias</hi> coming out of the Temple, could not ſpeak as he would have done. In this matter we condemn the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61072:49"/> Manichees who deny, that the beginning of evill unto man, being good, came from his free-will. We condemn alſo the Pelagians, who affirme that an evill man hath free-will ſufficiently to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme a good precept. Both theſe are confuted by the Scripture, which ſaith to the former, <hi>God made man upright,</hi> and to the latter, <hi>If the Son make you free, then are you free indeed.</hi>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61072:50"/> a right the ſtate of this fall, ſin, and mortalitie. For that free liberty of choice which God permitted to the will of man, he abuſed and kept not the law of his juſtice, but ſwerved therefrom, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in tranſgreſſed the commandement of God, inſomuch as he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the devill and thoſe lying ſpeeches of his, and gave credit unto them, and performed to the devill ſuch faith and obedience as was due to God alone: whereby he ſtripped and bereaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his poſteritie of the ſtate of perfection and goodneſſe of nature: and the grace of God, and thoſe good gifts of juſtice, and the Image of God, which in his creation were engraffed in him, he partly loſt them, and partly, corrupted and defiled them, as if with horrible poyſon one ſhould corrupt pure wine, and by this meanes he caſt headlong both himſelfe and all his off-ſpring into ſinne, death, and all kinde of miſeries in this life, and into puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments eternall after this life.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the ſpring and principall author of all evill is that cruell and deteſtable devill, the tempter, lyer, and manſlayer: and next the free will of man, which notwithſtanding being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to evill, through luſt and naughtie deſires and by perverſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, chooſeth that which is evill.</p>
                  <p>Hereby, ſinnes according to theſe degrees and after this order may be conſidered and judged of. The firſt and weightieſt or moſt grievous ſinne of all was without doubt after that ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> for the which death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> over all, even over thoſe alſo, which have not ſinned with like tranſgreſſion as did <hi>Adam.</hi> A ſecond kind is originall ſin, naturally ingendred in us and hereditarie, wherein we are all conceived and borne into this world. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I was borne in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>

The third kinde of ſinnes are thoſe which are called <hi>Actuall,</hi> which are the fruits of Originall ſinne, and doe burſt out within, without, privily and openly, by the powers of man, that is, by all that ever man is able to doe, and by his members, tranſgreſſing all thoſe things which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth and forbiddeth, and alſo running into blindneſſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours worthy to be puniſhed with all kinde of damnation. This doctrine of the true knowledge of ſinne, is of our men diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61072:51"/> handled and urged: and to this end were the firſt and ſecond Tables of the Law delivered to <hi>Moſes</hi> of God, that men eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially might know themſelves, that they are conceived and borne in ſin, and that forthwith, even from their birth, and by nature, they are ſinners, full of luſts, and evill inclinations.</p>
                  <p>For hereof it commeth, that ſtraight even from the beginning of our age, and ſo forth in the whole courſe of our life, being ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and overcome with many ſins, men doe in heart, thoughts, and evill deeds breake and tranſgreſſe the commandements of God, as it is written, <hi>The Lord looked down from heaven to behold the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>

And moreover that they which being plunged in theſe miſeries, and oppreſſed with theſe burthens, may again be ſtirred up to repentance, and to ſeeke for favour and help from God, which is a Father full of mercie and compaſſion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this is alſo expreſſely added, that the labours and torments which holy men doe ſuffer for the name of Chriſt, that is, in the cauſe of eternall ſalvation, for the holy truth of Chriſt, are an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleaſant ſacrifice to God, and have great and large promiſes, eſpecially in the life to come: the which thing alſo did even ſo fall out with Chriſt our Head, of whom the Epiſtle to the Hebrews ſpeaketh thus, that <hi>for the ioy that was ſet before him, he endured the croſſe:</hi> who alſo by himſelf conſecrated and hallowed the croſſe to them, even to this end, that thoſe ſufferings which we indure for Chriſt his names ſake, might be pleaſant and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God.</p>

                     <p>HEre many and great corruptions are deviſed of our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. <hi>I beleeve,</hi> nay, ſay they, I doubt: alſo, Then I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, when I ſhall have merits enow. Alſo, they doe not ſay, I beleeve certainely that remiſſion is given freely for the Sonne of God, not for any merits of ours, or any worthineſſe of ours. Alſo, They doe not rightly ſhew what ſinne is, and feigne that man is able to ſatisfie the Law of God, and that by the fulfilling of the Law, he becommeth juſt before God, in this life. Therefore firſt, as touching ſinne, and the cauſe thereof, we doe faithfully retaine the doctrine of the true Church of God. Seeing that God in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is one, the eternall Father, the coeternall Sonne, being the image of the Father, and the coeternall holy Ghoſt, proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, of infinite wiſedome, power, and goodneſſe, true, juſt, bountifull, chaſte, moſt free, as he deſcribeth himſelfe in his Law; and ſeeing he hath therefore made the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61072:55"/> and men, that being from all eternitie he might impart unto them his light, wiſedome, and goodneſſe, and that they ſhould be the temples of God, wherein God might dwell, that God might be all in all, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh: he therefore created them at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning good and juſt, that is, agreeing with the minde and will of God, and pleaſing him. He alſo gave them a cleere knowledge of God, and of his will, that they might underſtand that they were made of God, that they might be obedient, as it is written in the fifth <hi>Pſalme: Thou art not a God that loveth wickedneſſe.</hi> But the devils and men abuſed the libertie of their will, ſwarved from God, and by this diſobedience they were made ſubject to the wrath of God, and loſt that uprightneſſe, wherein they were created. Therefore free will in the devill and in men was the cauſe of that fall, not the will of God, who neither willeth ſinne, nor alloweth it, nor furdereth it, as it is written, <hi>When the Devill ſpeaketh a lie, he ſpeaketh of his owne, and he is the father of lying.</hi> And 1 <hi>John 3. He that committeth ſinne, is of the devill, becauſe the devill ſinneth from the beginning.</hi> Now ſinne, is that, whatſoever is contrary to the juſtice of God, which is an order in the minde of God (which he did afterward manifeſt by his own voyce in the Law and in the Goſpel) whether it be originall diſobedience, or actuall, for the which the perſon is both guiltie, and condemned with everlaſting puniſhment, except he obtaine remiſſion in this life, for the Sonne the Mediatours ſake.

                     <p>AS touching originall ſinne, we doe plainely affirme, that we doe retaine the conſent of the true Church of God, delivered unto us from the firſt Fathers, Prophets, Apoſtles and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſchollers, even unto <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and after his time: and we doe expreſly condemne <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and all thoſe who have ſcattered in the Church like doting follies to thoſe of the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> And we ſay, that all men, ſince the fall of our firſt parents, which are borne by the coupling together of male and female, doe together with their birth bring with them Originall ſinne, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61072:56"/> Rom. 5. <hi>By one man ſinne entred into the world, and by ſinne death.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ. 2. We were by nature the children of wrath as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> Neither doe we diſlike that uſuall definition, if it be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; <hi>Originall ſinne is a want of Originall iuſtice which ought to be in us:</hi> Becauſe that Originall juſtice was not onely an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mankinde before God, but in the very nature of man a light in the minde, whereby he might aſſuredly beleeve the word God: and a converſion of the will unto God, and an obedience of the heart agreeing with the judgement of the Law of God, which which was graffed in the minde: and, as we ſaid before, man was the temple of God, That <hi>Originall iuſtice</hi> doth comprehend all theſe things, it may beunderſtood by this ſaying. <hi>Man was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated after the Image and likeneſſe of God,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> doth thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, <hi>Epheſ. 4. Put ye on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,</hi> where undoubtedly by true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe he underſtandeth all thoſe vertues, which ſhine in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are given by God, not aſcited by art, or gotten by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (as now thoſe ſhadowes of vertues, ſuch as they are in men, be aſcited) becauſe that then God dwelling in man did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne him. And when we conſider what <hi>Originall iuſtice</hi> doth ſignifie, then the privation oppoſite thereunto is leſſe obſcure. Therefore <hi>Originall ſinne</hi> is, both for the fall of our firſt parents, and for the corruption which followed that fall, even in our birth to be ſubject to the wrath of God, and to be worthy of eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, except we obtaine remiſſion for the Mediatours ſake. And this corruption is, to want now the light or the preſence of God, which ſhould have ſhined in us: and it is an eſtranging of our will from God, and the ſtubbornneſſe of the heart reſiſting the law of the minde, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh; and, that man is not the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, but a miſerable Maſſe, without God, and without juſtice. Theſe wants, and this whole corruption, we ſay to bee ſinne, not onely a puniſhment of ſinne, and a thing indifferent, as many of the Sententiaries doe ſay, <hi>That theſe evils are onely a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and a thing indifferent, but not ſinne.</hi> And they doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate this Originall evill, and then they feigne that men may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the law of <hi>God,</hi> and by their owne fulfilling of the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come juſt.

                  <p>We teach alſo and beleeve, that the eternall Sonne of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<note place="margin">Matth. 1.</note> God was made the Sonne of man, of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> not by the meane of any man, as <hi>Hebion</hi> affirmed, but that he was moſt purely conceived by the holy Ghoſt, and was borne of <hi>Mary,</hi> who was alwaies a Virgin, even as the hiſtory of the Goſpell doth declare.

Moreover our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had not a ſoule without ſenſe and reaſon, as <hi>Apollinaris</hi> thought: nor fleſh without a ſoule, as <hi>Eunomius</hi> did teach; but a ſoule with it reaſon and fleſh with it ſenſes, by which ſenſes he felt true griefes in the time of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, even as he himſelfe witneſſeth when he ſaid, <hi>My ſoule is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie</hi>

                  <p>We acknowledge therefore that there be in one and the ſame Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, two natures, the divine, and the humane nature: and we ſay that theſe two are ſo conjoyned or united, that they are not ſwallowed up, confounded, or mingled together, but rather united or joyned together in one perſon, the proprieties of each nature being ſafe and remaining ſtill: ſo that we do worſhip one Chriſt our Lord, and not two, I ſay, one, true, God and man, as touching his divine nature, of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father, &amp; as touching his humane nature of the ſame ſubſtance with us, &amp; <hi>Like unto us in all things, ſin onely excepted.</hi> As therefore we deteſt the hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> maketh two Chriſts of one, &amp; diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the union of the Perſon, ſo doe we curſe the madneſſe of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiches,</hi> and of the <hi>Monophelites,</hi> or <hi>Monophyſicks,</hi> who overthrow the proprietie of the humane nature. Therefore we doe not teach that the divine nature in Chriſt did ſuffer, or that Chriſt according
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61072:61"/> to his humane nature is yet in the world, and even in every place. For we doe neither thinke nor teach, that the body of Chriſt ceaſed to be a true body after his glorifying, or that it was deified, and ſo deified, that it put off it properties, as touching body and ſoule, and became altogether a divine nature, and began to be one ſubſtance alone: And therefore we doe not allow or receive the unwittie ſubtilties, and the intricate, obſcure and inconſtant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of <hi>Schucnkfeildius,</hi> and ſuch other vaine janglers about this matter. Neither are we <hi>Schuenkfeildians.</hi> Moreover, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt did truely ſuffer and die for us in the fleſh, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith. We abhorre the moſt horrible madneſſe<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 1.</note> of the Iacobites and the Turkes, which abandon the paſſion of our Lord. Yet we denie not but that <hi>the Lord of glory</hi> (according to the ſaying of <hi>Paul,) was crucified for us.</hi> For we doe reverently<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 8.</note> and religiouſly receive and uſe the communication of proprieties drawne from the Scriptures, and uſed of all antiquitie in expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and reconciling places of Scripture, which at the firſt ſight ſeeme to diſagree one from another.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve and teach that the ſame Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in that true fleſh, in which he was crucified and died, roſe againe from the dead, and that he did not raiſe up another fleſh in ſtead of that which was buried, nor tooke a ſpirit in ſtead of fleſh, but retained a true body: Therefore whileſt that his diſciples thought that they did ſee the ſpirit of their Lord Chriſt, he ſhewed them his hands and feete, which were marked with the prints of the nailes and wounds, ſaying, <hi>Behold my hands and my feete, for I am he indeed:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>We beleeve that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in the ſame his fleſh did aſcend above all the viſible heavens into the very higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is to ſay, the ſeate of God and of the bleſſed ſpirits, unto the right hand of God the Father, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61072:62"/> ſhall moſt cruelly deſtroy the Church with fire and bloodſhed. Now Chriſt ſhall returne to redeeme his, and to aboliſh Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt by his coming, and to judge the quicke and the dead. For the dead ſhall ariſe, and <hi>thoſe which ſhall be found alive in that day</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> (which is unknowne unto all creatures) <hi>ſhall be changed in the twinckling of an eye, and all the faithfull ſhall be taken up to meete Chriſt in the ayre,</hi> that thenceforth they may enter with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven there to live for ever. But the unbeleevers or ungodly<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.

                  <p>Furthermore by his paſſion or death, and by all thoſe things<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 5.</note> which he did and ſuffered for our ſakes, from the time of his comming in the fleſh, our Lord reconciled his heavenly Father unto all the faithfull, purged their ſinne, ſpoiled death, broke in ſunder condemnation and hell, and by his reſurrection from the dead he brought againe and reſtored life, and immortalitie. For he is our righteouſneſſe, life, and reſurrection, and to be ſhort, he is the fulneſſe and perfection, the ſalvation and moſt abundant ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie of all the faithfull.

And now there remaineth nothing, but that we all ſhould give all glory to him beleeve in him, and reſt in him onely, contemning and rejecting all other aydes of our life. For they are fallen from the grace of God, and make Chriſt of no value unto themſelves, whoſoever they be that ſeeke ſalvation in any other things beſides Chriſt alone.</p>
                  <p>And to ſpeake many things in few words, with a ſincere heart we beleeve, and with libertie of ſpeech we freely profeſſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are defined out of the holy Scriptures, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Creeds, and in the Decrees of thoſe foure firſt and moſt excellent Councels holden at <hi>Nice, Conſtantinople, Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> together with bleſſed <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed, and all other Creeds like to theſe, touching the myſterie of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and we condemne all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſame.

                  <p>Of theſe promiſes there be three principall, wherein all the reſt are contained. The firſt was made in Paradiſe in theſe words, <hi>I will put enmitie betweene thee and the woman, and betweene thy ſeed</hi>

                  <p>Moreover, that he is alſo a true and naturall man, our brother in very deed, who hath a ſoule and a body, that is, true and perfect humane nature, which, by the power of the holy Ghoſt, he tooke, without all ſin, of <hi>Mary</hi> a pure Virgin: according as Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Word was made fleſh.</hi>

In theſe principall affections, as in a cheſt wherein treaſure is kept, are all thoſe wholſome fruits of our true juſtification laid up, &amp; are taken out from thence for the Elect and thoſe which doe beleeve, that in ſpirit and conſcience they may be partakers thereof through faith: which all hereafter, at the day of our joyfull reſurrection, ſhall be fully and perfectly beſtowed upon us. <hi>And towards the

                  <p>We beleeve that Ieſus Chriſt, being the wiſdome, and eternall<note place="margin">Artic. 14.</note> Son of the Father, tooke upon him our nature, ſo that he is one perſon, God and man. Man, I ſay, that might ſuffer both in ſoule and alſo in body, and <hi>made like unto us in all things, ſin onely except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> for that his fleſh was indeed the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> howbeit by the ſecret and incomprehenſible power of the holy Ghoſt, it was conceived in due time in the wombe of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin. And therefore we deteſt, as contrary to that truth, all thoſe hereſies wherwith the Churches were troubled in times paſt: and namely, we deteſt thoſe devilliſh imaginations of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetus,</hi> who gave to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, an imaginarie Deitie, whom he ſaid to be the Idea and patterne of all things, and the counterfeit or figurative Son of God: to conclude he framed him a body compacted of three elements uncreated, and therefore he did mingle and overthrow both his natures.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve that in one and the ſame perſon, which is Ieſus<note place="margin">Artic. 15.</note> Chriſt, thoſe two natures are truly and inſeperably ſo conjoyned, that they be alſo united, either of thoſe natures nevertheleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it diſtinct proprietie, ſo, that even as in this divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction the nature of the word reteining it proprieties, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uncreate, infinite, and filling all places; ſo alſo the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remained, and ſhall remaine for ever, finite, having it naturall forme, dimenſion, and alſo proprietie, as from the which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and glorification, or taking up to the right hand of the Father, hath not taken away the truth of the humane nature. Therefore we doe ſo conſider Chriſt in his Deitie, that we do not ſpoile him of his humanitie.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve that God did declare his infinite love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">Artic. 16.</note> towards us in this, that he hath ſent his Son, who ſhould die, and riſe againe, and fulfill all righteouſneſſe, that he might purchaſe eternall life for us.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve that by that onely ſacrifice, which Ieſus Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered<note place="margin">Artic. 17.</note> on the croſſe, we are reconciled to God, that we may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for juſt before him, becauſe we cannot be acceptable to him, nor enjoy the fruit of our adoption, but ſo farre forth, as he doth forgive us our ſins. Therefore we affirme, that Ieſus Chriſt is our entire and perfect waſhing, in whoſe death we obtaine full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, whereby we are delivered from all thoſe ſinnes whereof
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61072:66"/> we are guiltie, and from the which we could not be acquitted by any other remedie.</p>

                  <p>We beleeve that for our ſakes he died, and was buried, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into hell, the third day, by the power of his Godhead, returned to life and roſe againe, and that the fourth day after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whiles his diſciples beheld and looked upon him, he aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into heaven, to fulfill all things, and did place in Majeſtie and glory the ſelfe ſame body, where with he was borne, wherein he lived on earth, wherein he was jeſted at, wherein he had ſuffered moſt painfull torments, and cruell kinde of death, wherein he roſe againe, and wherein he aſcended to the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, above all rule, above all power, all force, all Dominion, and above every name, that is named, not onely in this world, but alſo in the world to come: And that there he now ſitteth, and ſhall ſit; till all things be fully perfected. And although the Majeſtie, and Godhead of Chriſt be every where aboundantly diſperſed, yet we beleeve, that his body, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>muſt need be ſtill in one place:</hi> and that Chriſt hath given Majeſtie unto his body, but yet hath not taken away from it the nature of a body, and that we muſt not ſo affirme Chriſt to be God, that we denie him to be man: and as the Martyr <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt hath left in, touching his humane nature, but hath not left us, touching his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature:</hi> and that the ſame Chriſt, though he be abſent from us, concerning his manhead, yet is ever preſent with us, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Godhead.</p>
                  <p>From that place alſo we beleeve that Chriſt ſhall come again to execute that generall judgement, as well of them whom be ſhall finde alive in the body, as of them that ſhall be ready dead.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:61072:67"/>
                  <p>And therefore that our onely ſuccour, and refuge is to flie to the<note place="margin">Artic. 18.</note> mercie of our Father by Ieſus Chriſt, and aſſuredly to perſwade our mindes, that he is the <hi>Obtainer of forgiveneſſe for our ſinnes: And, that by his blood, all our ſpots of ſin, be waſhed cleane: That he hath pacified, and ſet at one, all things by the blood of his croſſe:</hi> That he by the <hi>ſame one onely ſacrifice,</hi> which he once offered upon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> hath brought to effect, and fulfilled all things, and that for that cauſe he ſaid, when he gave up the Ghoſt, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> as though he would ſignifie, that the price, and ranſome was now fully paid for the ſin of mankinde.</p>
                  <p>If there be any, that thinke this ſacrifice not ſufficient, let them<note place="margin">Artic. 19.</note> goe in Gods name and ſeeke a better.

                  <p>To conclude, we beleeve that this our ſelfe ſame fleſh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<note place="margin">Artic. 21.</note> we live, although it die, and come to duſt, yet at the laſt ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne again unto life, by the means of Chriſts ſpirit, which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in us: and that then verily, whatſoever we ſuffer here in the meane while for his ſake, Chriſt will wipe away all teares and heavineſſe from our eyes: and that we through him ſhall enjoy everlaſting life, and ſhall for ever be with him in glory.

The which nature of man he put upon him, not onely in reſpect of the body, but alſo in reſpect of the ſoule: for he had alſo a true ſoule, to the intent he might be true and perfect man. For ſeeing that as well the ſoule, as the body of man, was ſubject to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould take upon him as well the ſoule, as the body, that he might ſave them both together. Therefore contrary to the hereſie of the Anabaptiſts, which deny that Chriſt did take upon him the fleſh of man, we confeſſe that Chriſt was partaker of fleſh and blood, as the reſt of his brethren were, that he came from the loynes of <hi>David,</hi> according to the fleſh, I ſay, that he was made of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> according to the ſame fleſh, and that he is a fruit of the Virgins wombe, borne of a woman, the branch of <hi>David,</hi> a flower of the root of <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> comming of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and of the Iews themſelves, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh: and to conclude, the true ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> the which ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> he tooke upon him, being made in all things like unto his brethren, ſin onely excepted, as hath been ſaid before, ſo that he is indeed our true Emmanuel, that is, God with us.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve alſo that the perſon of the Son was by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception<note place="margin">Artic. 19.</note> inſeparably united and coupled with the humane nature, yet ſo, that there be not two Sons of God, nor two perſons, but two natures joyned together in one perſon: both which natures doe ſtill retaine their owne proprieties. So that, as the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath remained alwayes uncreated, without the beginning of dayes, and tearme of life, filling both heaven and earth: ſo the humane nature hath not loſt his proprieties, but hath remained ſtill a creature, having both beginning of dayes and a finite nature. For whatſoever doth agree unto a true body, that it ſtill retaineth, and although Chriſt by his reſurrection hath beſtowed immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie upon it, yet notwithſtanding he hath neither taken away the trueth of the humane nature, nor altered it. For both our ſalvation, and alſo our reſurrection dependeth upon the trueth of Chriſts bodie. Yet theſe two natures are ſo united and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in one perſon, that they could not, no not in his death, be ſeparated the one from the other. Wherefore that, which in his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61072:68"/> death he commended unto his Father, was indeed a humane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, departing out of his body: but in the meane ſeaſon the divine nature did alwaies remaine joyned to the humane, even then when he lay in the grave: ſo that his Deitie was no leſſe in him at that time, then when as yet he was an infant, although for a ſmall ſeaſon it did not ſhew forth it ſelfe. Wherefore we confeſſe that he is true God, and true man: true God, that by his power he might overcome death: and true man, that in the infirmitie of his fleſh he might die for us.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve that God, which is both perfectly mercifull, and<note place="margin">Artic. 20.</note> perfectly juſt, did ſend his Son to take upon him that nature, which through diſobedience had offended, that in the ſelfe ſame nature he might ſatisfie for ſinne, and by his bitter death and paſſion pay the puniſhment that was due unto ſinne. God therefore hath declared and manifeſted his juſtice in his owne Sonne being loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with our iniquities: but hath moſt mercifully powred forth and declared his gracious goodneſſe unto us guiltie wretches, and worthie of condemnation, whileſt that in his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible love towards us, he delivered up his Sonne unto death for our ſins, and raiſed him up againe from death for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that by him we might obtaine immortalitie and life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve that Ieſus Chriſt is that high Prieſt, appointed to<note place="margin">Artic. 21.</note> that office eternally, by the oath of his Father, according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> which offered himſelfe in our name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father with a full ſatisfaction for the pacifying of his wrath, laying himſelfe upon the altar of the croſſe, and hath ſhed his blood for the cleanſing of our ſins, as the Prophets had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. For it is written, that <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was laid upon the Sonne of God, and by his wounds we are healed.</hi> Alſo that <hi>he was carried as a ſheepe unto the ſlaughter, reputed amongſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and unjuſt, and condemned of Pontius Pilate,</hi> as a malefactour, though before he had pronounced him guiltleſſe. Therfore he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that which he had not taken, and being juſt, ſuffered in ſoul and body for the unjuſt, in ſuch ſort, that feeling the horror of thoſe puniſhments that were due unto our ſins, <hi>he did ſweat water and blood,</hi> and at length <hi>cried out, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> All which he ſuffered for the remiſſion of our ſins. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do not without juſt cauſe profeſſe w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

Wherefore there is no need, that either we ſhould wiſh for any other meanes, or deviſe any of our owne braines, whereby we might be reconciled unto God beſides this <hi>one oblation once offered, by the which all the faithfull, which are ſanctified, are conſecrated, or perfected for ever.</hi> And this is the cauſe, why he was called the Angel <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that is to ſay, a Saviour, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes.</hi>

Then <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the ſecond obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. upon this confeſſion.</note> all creatures, and as well men, as women, and children, as many as have beene from the beginning, and ſhall be to the end of the world, ſhall appeare before this high Iudge, being ſummoned thither by the voyce of Archangels, and the trumpet of God. For all that have been dead ſhall then riſe out of the earth, the ſoule and ſpirit of every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned and coupled together againe to the ſame bodies, wherein before they lived. They moreover, which ſhall be alive at the laſt day, ſhall not die the ſame death that other men have done, but in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye they ſhall be changed from corruption, to an incorruptible nature. Then the bookes ſhall be opened, namely the bookes of every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the dead ſhall be judged according to thoſe things which they have done in this world, either good or evill. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, then ſhall men render an account of every idle word which they have ſpoken, although the world doe now make but a ſport and a jeſt at them. Finally, all the hypocriſie of men, and the deepeſt ſecrets of their hearts ſhall be made manifeſt unto all, ſo that worthily the onely remembrance of this judgement ſhall be terrible and fearfull to the wicked and reprobate. But of the godly and elect it is greatly to be wiſhed for, and is unto them exceeding comfort. For then ſhall their redemption be fully perfited and they ſhall reape moſt ſweet fruit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of all thoſe labours and ſorrowes, which they have ſuffered
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61072:69"/> in this world. Then, I ſay, their innocencie ſhall be openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged of all, and they likewiſe ſhall ſee that horrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Lord will execute upon thoſe, that have moſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically afflicted them in this world, with divers kindes of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and croſſes. Furthermore the wicked being convinced by the peculiar teſtimony of their owne conſcience, ſhall indeed be made immortall, but with this condition, that they ſhall burne for ever in that eternall fire, which is prepared for the devill. On the contrarie ſide the elect and faithfull ſhall be crowned with the crowne of glory and honour, whoſe names the Sonne of God ſhall confeſſe before his Father and the Angels, and <hi>then ſhall all teares be wiped from their eies.</hi> Then their cauſe, which now is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of hereſie and impietie by the Magiſtrates and Iudges of this world, ſhall be acknowledged to be the cauſe of the Son of God: And the Lord ſhall of his free mercy reward them with ſo great glory, as no mans minde is able to conceive. Therefore we doe with great longing expect that great day of the Lord, wherein we ſhall moſt fully enjoy all thoſe things which God hath promiſed unto us, and through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, be put into full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them for evermore.</p>

                  <p>ALſo we beleeve that our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, being true God, was alſo made true man, his natures not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, but ſo united in one and the ſame perſon, that they ſhall never hereafter be diſſolved. Neither doe we differ any thing in thoſe points, which the Church being taught out of the holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, doth beleeve, concerning our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and who at the length, after he had diſcharged the office of preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, died on the croſſe, and was buried, and deſcended into hell, and the third day he was called backe from the dead unto life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: the which life when he had by divers arguments prooved
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61072:70"/> unto witneſſes, hereunto appointed, he was carried up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the right hand of his Father, from whence we looke that he ſhould come to judge the quick and the dead. In the meane time let us acknowledge that he is nevertheleſſe preſent with his Church, that he doth renew, and ſanctifie it, and as his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Spouſe, beautifie it with all ſorts of ornaments of vertues: and in theſe things we doe nothing varie from the Fathers, nor from the common conſent of Chriſtians: we thinke it ſufficient, after this ſort to teſtifie our faith.</p>

The Lord ſhall raiſe up a Prophet from amongſt his owne brethren, &amp;c.</hi> And we doe acknowledge that the fathers had two kinde of promiſes revealed unto them, even as we have. For ſome of them were of preſent and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie things, ſuch as were the promiſes of the land of Canaan, and of victories, and ſuch as are now a dayes, concerning our daily bread. Otherſome there were then, and alſo are now, of heavenly and everlaſting things, as of Gods favour, remiſſion of ſinnes, and life everlaſting, through faith in Ieſus Chriſt. Now the fathers had not onely outward or earthly, but ſpirituall and heavenly promiſes in Chriſt. For the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the Prophets which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of the grace that ſhould come to us, have ſearched and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this ſalvation.</hi> Whereupon the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith, that <hi>the Goſpel of God was promiſed before by the Prophets of God in the holy Scriptures.</hi> Hereby then it appeareth evidently, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were not altogether deſtitute of all the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>And although after this manner our fathers had the Goſpel in the writings of the Prophets, by which they attained ſalvation in Chriſt through faith, yet the Goſpel is properly called that glad and happie tidings, wherein firſt by <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, then by Chriſt the Lord himſelfe, and afterward by the Apoſtles and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, is preached to us in the world, that God hath now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61072:72"/> that, which he promiſed from the beginning of the world, and hath ſent, yea and given unto us, his onely Sonne, and in him reconciliation with the Father, remiſſion of ſinnes, all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and everlaſting life. The hiſtory therefore ſet downe by the foure Evangeliſts, declaring how theſe things were done or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled of Chriſt, and what he taught and did, and that they which beleeved in him had all fulneſſe, this, I ſay, is truely called the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. The preaching alſo and Scripture of the Apoſtles, in which they expound unto us how the Sonne was given us of the Father, and in him all things pertaining to life and ſalvation, is truely called the doctrine of the Goſpel, ſo as even at this day it looſeth not that worthy name, if it be ſincere.</p>
                     <p>The ſame preaching of the Goſpel is by the Apoſtle tearmed <hi>the ſpirit,</hi> and the <hi>miniſterie of the ſpirit,</hi> becauſe it is living, and<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> working through faith in the eares, yea in the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thorough the illumination of the holy Spirit. For the <hi>letter,</hi> which is oppoſed unto the ſpirit, doth indeed ſignifie every out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing, but more ſpecially the doctrine of the Law, which without the ſpirit and faith worketh wrath, and ſtirreth up ſinne in the mindes of them, that doe not truely beleeve. For which cauſe it is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>the miniſtery of death:</hi> for hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pertaineth that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>The letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life.</hi> The falſe Apoſtles preached the Goſpel, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by mingling of the law there with, as though Chriſt could not ſave without the law. Such alſo were the <hi>Hebionites</hi> ſaid to be, which came of <hi>Hebion</hi> the heretike: and the Nazarites, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time were called Myneans. All which we doe condemne, ſincerely preaching the word, and teaching, that the beleevers are juſtified by the ſpirit onely, and not by the law. But of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there ſhall follow a more large diſcourſe in the title of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                     <p>And although the doctrine of the Goſpel compared with the Phariſees doctrine of the law might ſeeme (when it was firſt preached by Chriſt) to be a new doctrine, the which thing alſo <hi>Ieremy</hi> propheſied of the New Teſtament, yet indeed it not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was, and as yet is (though the Papiſts call it new, in regard of Popiſh doctrine, which hath of long time beene received) an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctrine, but alſo the moſt ancient in the world. For God<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.</note> from all eternitie fore-ordained to ſave the world by Chriſt: and this his predeſtination and eternall counſell hath he opened to the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61072:72"/> world by the Goſpel. Whereby it appeareth that the Evangelicall doctrine and religion was the moſt ancient of all that ever were, are, or ever ſhall be: Wherefore we ſay that all they erre foully, and ſpeake things unworthy the eternall counſell of God, who tearme the Evangelicall doctrine and religion, a new ſtart up faith ſcarce thirty yeeres old: to whom that ſaying of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth very well agree, <hi>Woe unto them that ſpeake good of evill, and evill of good, which put darkeneſſe for light, and light for darkeneſſe, that put bitter for ſweet, and ſweete for ſowre.</hi>

                  <p>This miniſtery is more honourable, greater, and more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſalvation, then are the ſacraments: the which is proved by that ſentence of the moſt excellent Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul, For Chriſt</hi>

                     <hi>ſent me not to Baptize</hi> (that is, not chiefly to doe this) <hi>but to preach the Goſpel.</hi> For onely through the pure Goſpel, and the preaching thereof, is ſaith ſowed inwardly in the heart by the holy Ghoſt, and from thence alſo muſt we conceive and ſeeke the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God and Chriſt, touching all things neceſſary to ſalvation, and alſo touching the ſacraments themſelves. Amongſt thoſe, who by reaſon of their age are able to uſe their underſtanding, it is of neceſſitie, that the preaching of the Goſpel goe before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacraments. Whereof we may ſee an evident proofe in thoſe three thouſand which were converted by <hi>Peter:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2. Acts 8.</note> alſo in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and in the Chamberlaine we may ſee, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of <hi>Philip,</hi> the queſtion is thus to be made. <hi>Doeſt thou beleeve with all thy heart?</hi> Then it may be that thou who haſt true faith grafted in thy heart mayeſt receive profit, by the participation of the Sacraments. For without the hearing of the word of God, <hi>which is the ſaving power of God,</hi> no man ſhall<note place="margin">Rom 1.</note> wittingly attaine unto faith and ſalvation, according to that ſaying of <hi>Paul, Therefore faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word</hi>

                     <hi>of God.</hi> And againe, <hi>How ſhall they beleeve in him, of whom they have not heard?</hi> Therefore herein our Preachers endevour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt earneſtly, that in our Eccleſiaſticall meetings they may propound unto the people the ſincere word of God, without all mixture or inventions of men. For which cauſe alſo they doe, by an ancient cuſtome, recite in the mother and vulgar tongue, which may be underſtood of all, not onely thoſe Chapters which are appointed to be read out of the Goſpel at certaine times, but alſo all other parts of holy Scripture, and do exhort the people with an earneſt deſire to heare the word of God, and to frequent thoſe Eccleſiaſticall meetings, that by the diligent teaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and by often repeating it in their Sermons, they may firſt teach the people repentance and faith, and then the uſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments, and by this meanes prepare them to the right receiving of the Sacraments: and afterwards alſo, both whileſt the Sacraments be adminiſtred, and after they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, they doe conveniently inſtruct them in all thoſe things

                  <p>In this place alſo is taught very diligently and as the matter requireth, touching the difference, which is to be obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the word, or doctrine, and worke of the law, and betwixt the word and force of the holy Goſpel. The word or miniſterie of the law and of the old Teſtament, is the word of death, feare, and of the letter, alſo the word of wrath and the word of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: but the word of the New Teſtament, that is, of the holy Goſpel, is the miniſterie of ſaith, and the ſpirit of cleareneſſe, or glory through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the word of grace, of the new covenant, the word of comfort, and the meſſenger of peace. Of them both the Apoſtle writeth thus, <hi>The letter killeth, but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit quickneth.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The words which I ſpeake, are ſpirit and life.

Now when the minde is terrified by this voyce

                     <p>VVE acknowledge that the Law of God (whereof the Tenne Commandements are an abridgement) doth command the beſt, the moſt juſt, and moſt perfect workes, and that man is not onely bound to obey the morall precepts of the Law, but alſo if he ſhould doe the workes of the Tenne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, in ſuch perfection and integritie as the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that he ſhould indeed be counted juſt before God for his workes, and ſhould obtaine eternall ſalvation by his merits. But whereas ſome men doe thinke, that man can come to that ſtate in this life, as to be able by his workes not onely to fulfill the tenne Commandements, but alſo to do more and greater works, then are commanded in the law, which they call the workes of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errogation, it is contrary to the doctrine of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and it is repugnant to the judgement of the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. For the law was not given to this end, to ſignifie, that man might perfectly fulfill the Commandements thereof in this life, but to ſhew to man his imperfection, and to teſtifie of the unrighteouſneſſe of man, and of the wrath of God againſt all men, and to ſtirre them up to ſeeke remiſſion of their ſinnes, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſalvation by faith in the onely Sonne of God, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 3.

                     <p>ALthough many precepts of the law of God be conteined in the writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelfe doth teach, that <hi>we muſt not render evill for evill, nor lock upon a woman want only,</hi> and ſuch like: yet we muſt not thinke that the Goſpel of Chriſt is a new law: whereby, as the fathers in times paſt were ſaved under the Old Teſtament by the old law, ſo men now under the New Teſtament ſhould be ſaved by a new law. For except a man take the name of the law generally for doctrine, as the Prophets now and then doe uſe the name of the law, certainly the Goſpel of Chriſt, is not properly a law, as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61072:75"/> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> doth commonly uſe the name of the law, but it is a good and joyfull meſſage, touching the ſionne of God, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that he onely is the purger of our ſinnes, the appeaſer of the wrath of God, and our Redeemer and Saviour.</p>
                     <p>Neither are the commandements of the law, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Apoſtles writings, any new law, but they are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the old law, according to the judgement of the holy Ghoſt, which alſo were to be ſeene before, and that not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, in the writings of the Prophets. But they are repeated in the preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt, that the ſeveritie of the law of God, and the corruption of our nature being declared, we might be ſtirred up to ſeeke and embrace Chriſt revealed in his Goſpel, and that we may know after what rule we are to frame our life through faith in Chriſt. Wherefore if we will ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of the law of God, and Goſpel of Chriſt, as of Chriſt we are not to make a new lawgiver, ſeeing that he neither hath made a new law, nor inſtituted a new politike kingdome in this earth, ſo muſt we not make a new law of the Goſpel, which by more hard and ſevere commandements doth bring eternall ſalvation to the doers thereof. But we thinke it to be moſt certaine, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall or morall law of the old and new Teſtament is one and the ſame, and that neither the men which lived under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor thoſe which lived under the new Teſtament, doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine eternall ſalvation, for the merit of the workes of the law, but onely for the merit of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, through faith.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61072:76"/> the worke of our owne ſtrength. For the Apoſtle doth will the faithfull Miniſter diligently to <hi>Inſtruct thoſe which withſtand the truth, if that at any time the Lord will give them repentance, that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>they may acknowledge the truth.</hi> Alſo the ſinnefull woman in the Goſpel, which waſhed Chriſts feet with her teares, and <hi>Peter</hi> which bitterly wept and be wailed his deniall of his Maſter, doe manifeſtly ſhew, what minde the penitent man ſhould have, to wit, very earneſtly lamenting his ſins committed. Moreover the Prodigall ſonne, and the Publican in the Goſpel that is compared with the Phariſie, doth ſet forth unto us a moſt fit patteme of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing our ſinnes to God. The Prodigall ſonne ſaid, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and againſt thee, I am not worthy to be called thy ſonne, make me as one of thy hiped ſervants.</hi> The Publican alſo not daring to lift up his eyes to heaven, but knocking his breſt, he cryed, <hi>God be mercifull unto me a ſinner.</hi> And we doubt not but the Lord received them to mercy.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61072:77"/> brother that is learned in the law of God, we doe not miſlike it. Like as alſo we doe fully allow that generall and publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which is wont to be reheatſed in the Church and in holy meetings (whereof we ſpake before) being as it is agreeable with the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the keies of the kingdome of heaven, which the<note place="margin">All theſe things which are ſpoken of the keies, doe properly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the 10. Sect.</note> Lord committed to his Apoſtles, they prate many ſtrange things, and of theſe keies they make ſwords, ſpears, ſcepters, and crowns, and full power over mightie kingdomes, yea and over mens ſouls and bodies. But we judging uprightly according to the word of God, doe ſay that all Miniſters truely called, have and exerciſe the keies, or the uſe of them, when as they preach the Goſpel, that is to ſay, when they doe teach, exhort, reprove, and keepe in order the people committed to their charge. For ſo doe they open the kingdome of God to the obedient, and ſhut it againſt the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. Theſe keies did the Lord promiſe to the Apoſtles, in the 16. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and delivered them in <hi>John</hi> 20. Chapter, <hi>Marke 16. Luke</hi> the 24. when as he ſent forth his diſciples, and commanded them <hi>To preach the Goſpel in all the world, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſinnes.</hi> The Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Lord gave to his Miniſters the miniſtery of reconciliaiton.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> And what this was, he ſtraight way maketh plaine, and ſaith, <hi>The word or doctrine of reconciliation.</hi> And yet more plainly, expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his words he addeth, that the Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>Do as it were goe an embaſſage in Chriſt name, as if God himſelfe ſhould by his Miniſters exhort the people to be reconciled to God,</hi> to wit, by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience. They uſe the keies therefore, when as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to faith and repentance. Thus doe they reconcile men to God, thus they forgive ſinnes thus doe they open the kingdomne of heaven, and bring in the beleevers: much differing herein from thoſe, of whom the Lord ſpake in the Goſpel, <hi>Wo be unto you Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, for ye have taken away the key of knowledge. You have not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in your ſelves, and thoſe that would have entered, ye forbad.</hi> Rightly therefore and effectually doe Miniſters abſolve, when as they preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, and thereby remiſſion of ſinnes, which is promiſed to every one that beleeveth, even as every one is baptized, and doe teſtifie of it, that it doth particularly appertain to all. Neither doe we imagine that this abſolution is made any whit more effectuall, for that which is mumbled into ſome prieſts care, or upon ſome mans head particularly: yet we judge that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61072:77"/> men muſt be taught diligently, to ſeek remiſſion of ſinnes in the bloud of Chriſt, and that every one is to be put in minde, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes doth belong unto him. But how diligent and carefull every penitent man ought to be in the endevour of a new life, and in ſlaying the old man, and raiſing up the new man, the examples in the Goſpel doe teach us. For the Lord ſaith to him, whom he had healed of the palſie, <hi>Behold thou art made whole, ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> Likewiſe to the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe<note place="margin">Iohn 5. Iohn 8.</note> woman, which was delivered, he ſaid, <hi>goe thy way, and ſinne no more.</hi> By which words he did not meane that any man could be free from ſinne, whiles he lived in this fleſh, but he doth commend unto us diligence and an earneſt care, that we (I ſay) ſhould ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all meanes, and beg of God by prayer, that we might not fall againe into ſinne, out of which we are riſen after a manner, and that we may not be overcome of the fleſh the world, or the devill. <hi>Zacheus</hi> the Publican, being received into favour by the Lord, he cryeth out in the Goſpel. <hi>Behold Lord, the halfe of my goods I give</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 9.</note> 
                     <hi>to the poore, and if I have taken from any man any thing by forged cavillation, I reſtore him foure fold.</hi> After the ſame manner we preach that reſtitution and mercy, yea and giving of almes, are neceſſary for them which doe truely repent. And generally out of the Apoſtles words we exhort men, ſaying, <hi>Let not ſinne reigne in</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>your mertall body, that you ſhould obey it through the luſts thereof. Neither give ye your members as weapons of unrighteouſneſſe to ſin: but give your ſelves unto God, as they that are alive from the dead, and give your members as weapons of righteouſneſſe unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore we condemne all the ungodly ſpeeches of certain, which abuſe the preaching of the Goſpel, and ſay, To returne unto God, is very eaſie, for Chriſt hath purged all our ſinnes. For give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes is eaſily obtained: What therefore will it hurt to ſinne? And, we need not take any great care for repentance, &amp;c. Notwithſtanding we alwaies teach, that an entrance unto God is open for all ſinners, and that this God doth forgive all the ſinnes of the faithfull, onely that one ſinne excepted, which is committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Mar. 3.</note> the holy Ghoſt.

                     <p>Now repentance conſiſteth properly of theſe two parts, one is contrition or terrours, ſtricken into the conſcience through the ſight of ſinne: The other is faith, which is conceived by the Goſpel or by abſolution, and doth beleeve that for Chriſt ſake the ſins be forgiven, and comforteth the conſcience, and freeth it from terrours. Then there muſt follow good works, which are fruits of repentance.</p>
                     <p>They condemne the Anabaptiſts, who denie that men once ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified can looſe the ſpirit of God, and doe ſtiffely hold that ſome men may attaine to ſuch a perfection in this life, that they can ſin no more. In like caſe the Novatians are condemned, which would not abſolve ſuch as had fallen after Baptiſme, though they returned to repentance. They alſo that teach that remiſſion of ſins is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for our owne love or good works, and ſuch as teach that Canonicall ſatisfactions are neceſſary to redeeme everlaſting or purgatorie paines, are wholly miſliked of us.</p>
                     <p>Concerning confeſſion of ſins they teach, that private abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be retained ſtill in Churches, though it be a needleſſe thing in confeſſion to make a rehearſall of the ſins. For it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing to reckon up all a mans offences, according as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Who doth underſtand his faults, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THE Divines and Canoniſts have caſt a great miſte of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe chiefly upon this point of Chriſtian doctrine touching repentance: as not onely their books doe teſtifie, but alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all the godly, which doe confeſſe that the intricate and endleſſe diſputations of the Divines, and the infinite tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61072:82"/> about the matter of repentance, was even a fearefull racking of their conſciences. For they doe no where teach any certaintie, how remiſſion of ſins is obtained. And as for faith, there is no word amongſt them. Yea they bid men to be alwayes in doubt of remiſſion of ſins. Afterward they torment mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, with a harſh reckoning up of their faults, and with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions. For what a ſnare unto a mans conſcience was the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which requireth them to reckon up all their ſins?</p>
                     <p>As for ſatisfactions, they did obſcure and darken the benefit of Chriſt, becauſe that even the learned among them did imagine that eternall death was recompenſed by them. But the unlearned were perſwaded that forgiveneſſe of the fault was purchaſed by ſuch deeds. What that their ſervices for the moſt part were not commanded of God? as babling of prayers, invocation of Saints, Pilgrimages, and ſuch like ſtuffe. Thus was the pure doctrine of repentance overwhelmed with an huge heap of unprofitable and evill opinions. And it is manifeſt that the godly in many ages paſt have greatly wiſhed that this doctrine had been more purely taught.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, it is eſpecially needfull that the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſhould be taught in the Church moſt purely and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Therefore our Divines have laboured to cleare this point as much as might be. And ſurely they have ſo opened and cleared it, that the ſoundeſt even amongſt our adverſaries do confeſſe, that in this matter they have well deſerved of the Church. For we doe ſimply and plainly without any Sophiſtry lay forth that, which tho Goſpel teacheth touching repentance, that men may perceive how they muſt returne unto Chriſt, by what means remiſſion of ſins is obtained, what worſhip and what works doe pleaſe God. Firſt we teach that Contrition is requiſite, that is, the true terrors and ſorrows of the minde, which feeleth the wrath of God, is grieved for ſin committed, and ceaſeth to doe evill. And though theſe ſorrows be requiſite, yet muſt we know that remiſſion of ſins is not granted for the worthineſſe of contrition, or of theſe ſorrows, but we muſt joyne faith with them, that is, a truſt and confidence of mercie promiſed for Chriſts ſake, and we hold, that our ſins are freely forgiven for Chriſts ſake.</p>
                     <p>When we once are comforted in theſe terrours by faith, we do undoubtedly obtaine remiſſion of ſins, as we have ſaid before. And this faith our mindes doe conceive by the Goſpel; alſo by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61072:83"/> which preacheth and applyeth the Goſpel unto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed conſciences. And for this cauſe doe our Divines teach, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 5. Obſervat.</note> that private Abſolution is to be retained in the Church, and they ſet out the dignitie of it, and the power of the Keyes, with true and very large commendations: namely, becauſe the power of the Keyes doth diſpenſe the Goſpel not onely to all in generall, but alſo to every * one in particular: as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt won thy brother, &amp;c.</hi> and becauſe we muſt beleeve the voice of the Goſpel, which is diſpenſed unto us in abſolution by the miniſtery of the Church, no otherwiſe then a voice ſounding from heaven.</p>
                     <p>This whole benefit of abſolution and of this miniſterie hath heretofore been wholly obſeured with the falſe opinions of ſuch, as taught, that abſolution was naught worth, without ſufficient contrition, and did afterwards will men to miſdoubt of abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe no man knew whether his contrition were ſufficient or not. What elſe was this but quite to take away from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences the comfort of the Goſpel, and to remoove out of the Church and cleane to aboliſh the miniſtery of the Goſpel or the power of the Keyes? Who doth not ſee that theſe pernitious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are worthily reprooved?</p>
                     <p>Now ſeeing that confeſſion yeeldeth a place where to beſtow abſolution in private, and this cuſtome doth uphold the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the power of the Keyes, and remiſſion of ſins, among the people; beſides, ſeeing that this conference availeth much for admoniſhing and inſtructing of men, therefore we doe duely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Confeſſion in our Churches, yet ſo, as that we teach that reckoning up of the faults is not neceſſary by Gods Law, and that mens conſciences are not to be clogged with it. For there is no commandement in all the Apoſtles Writings ſounding that way. Again, this rehearſing of all ones ſins is a thing impoſſible, according to that in the Pſalme, <hi>Who can underſtand his faults.</hi> And <hi>Jeremie</hi> ſaith, <hi>The heart of man is corrupt and unſearchable.</hi> But if no ſins could be forgiven, but ſuch as are reckoned up, mens conſciences could never be at reſt, becauſe they neither ſee, nor can call to minde the greateſt number of them. Whereby it may eaſily be gathered, that the miniſterie of abſolution and remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins doth not depend upon the condition of numbring them up all.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Writers alſo doe teſtifie that this counting of ſins by tale is a thing needleſſe. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on the Epiſtle to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61072:83"/> Hebrews ſaith, <hi>Let us reckon of it, that we have ſins, and let not the tongue alone utter it, but the conſcience within us alſo. And let us not barely ſay we are ſinners, but let us reckon up our ſins particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, I doe not bid thee to bewray thy ſelfe openly, nor to accuſe thy ſelfe to other, but to follow the ſaying of the Prophet, Lay open thy wayes before the Lord confeſſe thy ſins before God, utter thy ſins with prayer before the true Iudge, not remembring them with the tongue, but with the conſcience, and then indeed maiſt thou hope to finde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi> That Sermon of <hi>Chryſoſtomes,</hi> teacheth not onely what is to be thought of reckoning up of ſinnes, but doth alſo very wiſely joyne contrition and faith together, as they are joyned by us. Firſt, he will have us acknowledge our ſins unfainedly, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre them from our hearts: In the next place he teacheth to adde thereunto prayer and faith, which may aſſure us that we are forgiven. Elſe where he ſaith, <hi>Acknowledge thy ſins that thou maiſt do them away. If thou art aſhamed to ſhew thy ſins to any man, then utter them every day in thy heart: I ſay not, goe, confeſſe thy ſins to thy fellow ſervant, that may upbraid thee with them, but confeſſe them unto God that is able to cure them.</hi> The Gloſſe upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees touching Penance, the 5. diſtinct. granteth <hi>that Confeſſion was ordained of the Church, and is not commanded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old and New Teſtament:</hi> of the ſame judgement are many of the Doctors. Wherefore our judgement touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of Confeſſion is neither new nor without reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, there is moſt need of all that the godly ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, touching ſatisfactions. For there was more hurt and danger in them, then in numbring up of ſins, in as much as they darkened the benefit of Chriſt: becauſe that the unlearned thought they did obtaine remiſſion of the guilt of ſinne for their owne works ſake: and beſides mens conſciences were much diſtreſſed if ought were omitted that was injoyned for ſatisfaction. Again, ceremonies and pilgrimages, and ſuch like fruitleſſe works, were thought meet for ſatisfaction, rather then things commanded of God. And forſooth their teachers themſelves dreamed that eternall death was fully redeemed by them. Therefore we thought it needfull that godly mindes ſhould be ſet free from ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and we teach that their Canonicall ſatisfactions, which they call works not due, &amp;c. are neither availeable for the remiſſion either of the fault or everlaſting puniſhment, nor yet neceſſary.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61072:84"/> It was a cuſtome long ſince in the Church, that in publike penance ſuch as had fallen and did returne to the Church againe, ſhould not be received without ſome puniſhment laid upon them for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſake from which cuſtome theſe ſatisfactions did ſpring. But the futhers minde was by ſuch examples to fray the people from ſins: they did not account that Ceremonie to be a juſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the fault, or for eternall death, or for purgatory pains. Theſe things were after wards coyned by ignorant and unlearned men. But thoſe ancient cuſtomes <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 6. Obſervat.</note> were in time worne out of uſe, and laid aſide. As for us, we doe not but then mens conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with ſatisfactions: but this we teach, that the fruits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are neceſſarie, and that obedience, the feare of God, faith, love, chaſtitie, and the whole renuing of the ſpirit ought to increaſe in us.</p>
                     <p>We give men warning <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 7. Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of this alſo, that ſins are eft-ſoones puniſhed even by temporall puniſhments in this life, as <hi>David, Manaſſes,</hi> and many others were puniſhed, and we teach that theſe puniſhments may be mitigated by good works, and the whole practice of repentance, as <hi>Paul</hi> declareth, <hi>If we would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>Thus whereas before the diſputations were intricate and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and full of groſſe opinions, now that doctrine being purged is delivered to the people ſo, as it may be underſtood, and avails much unto godlineſſe. We doe ſtill hold and ſet forth the true parts of Repentance, Contrition, Faith, Abſolution, Remiſſion of ſinnes, Amendment of the whole life, Mitigation of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent puniſhments: and we are in good hope, that the godly will not onely not reprehend any thing in this place, but alſo will give them thanks which have purged this point of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is requiſite and profitable in all Churches to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded moſt plainly and ſet out moſt clearely.

                     <p>BY the mercie of God this part of Doctrine ſpecially is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our Churches with great perſpicuitie, whereas the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries have wrapped it in moſt intricate Labyrinthes. Firſt, we doe openly condemne the catharans, and the Novatians, who feigned that neither the elect could fall into ſins againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, neither that they who had fallen after their amendment were to be received againe, and our confutations of theſe furies are extant. Neither doe we goe about to make brawlings about the word <hi>Repentance:</hi> if any man like it better, let him uſe the word <hi>Converſion,</hi> which word the Prophets alſo have often uſed. Moreover, we doe willingly retaine the word <hi>Contrition,</hi> and we ſay that the firſt part of Repentance or Converſion is Contrition, which is, truely to tremble through the knowledge of the wrath of God againſt ſins, and to be ſorry that we have offended God: and we ſay, that there muſt needs be ſome ſuch great feare and griefs in thoſe that are converted, and that they doe not repent, which remaine ſecure and without griefe, as it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. Ye ſorrowed to repentance:</hi> And, <hi>Ezech. 20. And ye ſhall miſlike your
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61072:85"/> ſelves in your own ſight, and acknowledge your ſelves to be worthy of puniſhment and deſtruction.</hi> And theſe true griefes are a feeling of the wrath of God, as is declared more at large in another place. But here we reproove our adverſaries, who feigne that Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth deſerve Remiſſion of ſinnes, and that Contrition muſt be ſufficient. In either errour there be great myſts. For remiſſion is given freely for the Mediatours ſake, and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition can be ſufficient? Yea rather the more the ſorrow increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth without aſſurance of mercie, ſo much the more mens hearts doe flie from God, and no creature is able to ſuſtaine the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this ſorrow, whereof <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, Chap. 38. <hi>He brake all my bones, like a Lion.</hi> But thoſe idle dreames of the Writers doe declare, that they lead a careleſſe life, and that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull in the Goſpel. Now theſe true ſorrows doe ariſe, when the ſinne of the contempt of the Son of God (as is declared in the Goſpel) is reprooved <hi>The ſpirit ſhall reproove the world of ſin, becauſe they beleeve not in me. Ioh.</hi> 16. And by the voice of the Morall law other ſins are reprooved, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom. 3. By the law came the knowledge of ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As touching private confeſſion, to be made unto the Paſtours, we affirme, that the ceremonie of <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the firſt obſervat. upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> private abſolution is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Church, and we doe conſtantly retaine it for many weightie cauſes: yet withall we doe teach, that men muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther command; nor require the recitall of offences in that private talke, becauſe that recitall of offences is neither commanded of God, nor a thing poſſible, and it maketh godly mindes to doubt, and it maketh faith faint.</p>
                     <p>And this we doe much more reprehend, that in the doctrine of Repentance or Converſion, our adverſaries doe no where make mention of juſtifying faith, (whereof we have ſpoken before) by which alone Remiſſion of ſins is truely received, the heart is lifted up even when it hath a feeling of the wrath of God; and we are freed from the ſorrows of hell, as it is written. <hi>Rom. 5. Being iuſtified by faith, we have peace.</hi> Without this faith ſorrows are no better then the repentance of <hi>Saul, Judas, Oreſtes,</hi> and ſuch like, as are mentioned in Tragedies. Neither doe our adverſaries teach the Goſpel, but the Law, and humane traditions, either omitting this faith, elſe fighting againſt it. But ſeeing that in a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion there muſt be theſe changes, a mortification, and a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. and in divers other places, for doctrines
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61072:85"/> ſake we doe divide converſion or repentance into three parts, into contrition, faith, and new obedience: theſe things doth true converſion comprehend, as the voice of God, and the true expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Church doe declare. Yet doe we not make conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either about the manner of ſpeaking, or about the number of the parts, but we wiſh that all men may ſee thoſe things which are neceſſary. And it is moſt neceſſary for the Church, that there ſhould be a true, plaine, and moſt cleare doctrine, touching the whole converſion, which alſo is very often repeated in thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which are ſet down in the Scriptures, and that with great perſpicuitie, and without any intricate labyrinthes, as the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and Chriſt ſay, <hi>Matth. 3. Repent, and beleeve the Goſpel.</hi> Againe, <hi>Repent: Behold the Lambe of God, that taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom. 3. All men are deprived of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</hi> Here he ſpeaketh of contrition, afterward of remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>But we are iuſtified freely by his grace, through redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſus by faith.</hi> Therefore it is neceſſary, that in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of converſion or repentance there ſhould mention be made of faith. Neither is it ſufficient that our adverſaries ſay, that they alſo doe ſpeake of faith, and that faith doth goe before repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For they ſpeake of the doctrine of knowledge, I beleeve the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, to wit, that they be forgiven to others, even as the devils doe know the Creed: but the Goſpel doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this true faith, which is an aſſurance of the mercie of God, promiſed for the Sonne of God his ſake, and reſting in the Sonne of God, which faith, I beleeve that remiſſion of ſins is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me alſo, and that freely, not for any Contrition, not for any my merits, but for the Sonne of God, who by the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wiſdome of the Godhead is appointed a Mediatour and Redeemer. I know that the commandement of God is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo that every one may determine in theſe griefes, that he is aſſuredly received into favour for Chriſt his ſake. This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per voice of the Goſpel: this Decree is brought by the Son out of the boſome of the eternall Father, and is ſealed up by his blood and reſurrection. Not to aſſent to this Will and Decree, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Son of God: and concerning this ſinne, <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>cap. 3. He that beleeveth not the Sonne, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> But he that beleeveth that his ſins be forgiven for this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours ſake, he doth now certainly receive remiſſion of his ſins for Chriſt his ſake, which is effectuall in him, and quickneth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61072:86"/> and ſanctifieth him by his holy Spirit: and being now reconciled, he is undoubtedly accounted juſt, for the Mediatours ſake, and is heire of eternall life. Either to omit, or to corrupt, or to diſlike this neceſſary comfort, touching converſion, is as much as manifeſtly to extinguiſh the goſpel. As touching this faith, abſolution ought both to admoniſh us, and alſo to confirme it, as <hi>David</hi> was confirmed, when he heard this abſolution, 2 <hi>Reg. 12. The Lord hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy ſinne.</hi> So know thou that the voyce of the Goſpel doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare remiſſion unto thee alſo, the which remiſſion is namely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to thee in abſolution. Doe not thou feigne, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel doth nothing at all pertaine to thee, but know that it was therefore publiſhed, that by this meanes men imbracing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel might be ſaved, and that it is the eternall and immutable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, that thou ſhouldeſt beleeve it. He that doth not by this faith imbrace the Goſpel, but is ſtil doubting, he doth in vaine heare the abſolution. When as by this comfort the hearts are quickned, and are now made the dwelling places of God. Then is it neceſſary that they ſhould now begin a new obedience, as is ſaid before. But to returne to wicked deeds, is to ſhake off God, and again to loſe that righteouſneſſe and life, as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. He that doth righteouſneſſe, is righteous, he that committeth ſinne, is of the devill.</hi> But we have before rehearſed the ſumme of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of new obedience.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61072:86"/> be knowne that they did unfainedly aske pardon, and for examples it might profit others, but for certaine daies abſolution was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they might be ſeene to aske pardon publikely. So was that inceſtuous Corinthian debarred, and afterward received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, not without deliberation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. This whole cuſtome was appointed <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 4. obſervation.</note> for examples ſake, and is politicall, nothing at all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the remiſſion of ſins. But afterward through ſuperſtition it ſo increaſed, that faſts and forbearing the company of man or wife, were injoyned for many yeeres. When theſe burthens had increaſed too much, the Biſhops did releaſe them againe, and this releaſe of ſuch rites was called <hi>Indulgence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Monks not conſidering the hiſtory of theſe things, feigned that eternall puniſhment might be recompenſed by the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Purgatorie, or other puniſhments of this life: and they added, that Satisfactions were injoyned of the Church, that thoſe puniſhments might be mitigated: and that ſatisfactions ſhould be workes not due by the law of God. We reject theſe Monkiſh fables, which even they themſelves doe not underſtand, and we retaine moſt ſure rules, to wit, That eternall puniſhments are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted together with the fault, for the Sonne his ſake, not for any our ſatisfactions, according to that which is written in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> Chap. 13. <hi>O death, I will be thy death: O hell, I will be thy deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Rom. 5. Being iuſtified by faith, we have peace.</hi> Secondly we ſay that theſe not due workes, whereof theſe men ſpeake, are not any worſhip of God, or ſatisfactions, but that they doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this ſaying, <hi>Matth. 15. They doe in vaine worſhip me with the commandements of men.</hi> And <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the fifth obſervat. upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> certainly the power of the keies hath no commandement to injoyne ſuch puniſhments. Alſo we feare that this applying of indulgences, by which the Pope doth apply the merits of Saints unto others, is but counterfeit, and that the indulgences in times paſt were nothing elſe, but a releaſing of the Canons, which did nothing appertaine to thoſe ſatisfactions whereof the Monks do ſpeake. Now it is another thing to ſpeake of ſatisfaction which is due, as of the reſtoring of theft, of that which hath beene gotten by uſury, of another mans wife, or his good name.</p>
                     <p>This reſtitution is a worke that is due, pertaining to new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ. 4. Let him that hath ſtolne ſteale no more.</hi> He that withholdeth another mans wiſe, hath neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, faith, nor new obedience. Neither are the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61072:87"/> of God, touching due ſatisfaction, which we ſay ought to be made, to be mingled with thoſe trifling ſongs of Popiſh ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions. Alſo this we confeſſe, that in this life many horrible pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments are ſpread over the Church, over Empires, and over families, for certaine ſinnes of many men, yea even of the Elect: as the ſedition that was raiſed up againſt <hi>David,</hi> did not lightly afflict that whole civill regiment, and many holy families. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we diſtinguiſh betwixt eternall puniſhment, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this life: and we ſay, that eternall puniſhment is remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely for the Sonne of God his ſake, when we are juſtified and quickned by faith.</p>
                     <p>And albeit that even temporall puniſhments <note n="*" place="margin">Locke the 6. Obſervat.</note> are chiefly mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated for the Sonne of God his ſake, who is the harbour for the Church, becauſe this weake nature cannot ſuſtaine the greatneſſe of the wrath of God, as <hi>Daniel</hi> prayeth, <hi>Chap. 9. For the Lords ſake heare thou us, and have an eye unto our helpe, &amp;c.</hi> Yet we teach this alſo, that even for the very converſions ſake our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are mittigated, becauſe that in the Saints the legall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being added to their workes, are not without their effect, but have their rewards: Such a promiſe is this: <hi>Give, and it ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto you.</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. If we would iudge our ſelves, we ſhould not be iudged,</hi> he ſpeaketh of whole repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not of thoſe moſt vaine ſhadowes, which they reaſon to prevaile, although a man fall againe into mortall ſinne. And in this matter they have deviſed new jugling tricks. They confeſſe that theſe ſatisfactions are not recompences, but they ſay, that we muſt admit ſuch ſatisfactions as chaſtiſements, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the <hi>Corinthian, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. That chaſtiſement was excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: and we confeſſe, that they which are guiltie of manifeſt hainous deedes, are by a lawfull judgement and order to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, neither is juſt excommunication a vaine light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

                     <p>VVE call Contrition a feeling of the wrath of God, or a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and great feare of the mind, raiſed by the knowledge of the greatneſſ of our ſinnes, and the weightineſſe of the wrath of God. And we thinke that ſuch a Contrition, as the law of God doth uſe to ſtirre up in man, is neceſſarily required in true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but to teach that it doth deſerve remiſſion of ſinnes, or that it is a purging of our ſinnes before God, we thinke in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtolike doctrine. God truely doth not deſpiſe a contrite and an humble heart, as the <hi>Pſalme</hi> ſaith: but therefore he doth not deſpiſe it, becauſe the Sonne of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt tooke upon him a contrite and humble heart, by whoſe onely contrition and humiliation our ſins are purged before God, and his wrath is pacified. Now we are made partakers of this pacification, when with a contrite and humble heart we beleeve, that Ieſus Chriſt alone is our reconciler with the heavenly Father, Iſa. 53. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was broken for our iniquities: the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> 1 Iohn 2. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſinnes.</hi> Act. 10. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his name, all that beleeve in him, ſhall have remiſſion of their ſinnes.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the examples of <hi>Cain, Eſau, Saul, Judas</hi> Iſcarioth, and ſuch
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61072:88"/> like, doe witneſſe, that Contrition is not a merit of remiſſion of ſinnes.

The <hi>Gloſſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>If we looke narrowly to the matter, remiſsion of ſinnes is to be attributed to the grace of God, not to contrition.</hi> Wherefore we confeſſe, that to ſhew forth true repentance, Contrition is neceſſarie, yet not to this end, that it ſhould be any merit or purging of our ſinnes before God: but that man, acknowledging the greatneſſe of his ſinnes, ſhould be ſtirred up to ſeeke remiſſion of ſinnes and ſalvation, in the onely free clemencie and mercy of God, and that onely for Ieſus Chriſt our Lord his ſake, by faith.</p>

One is, that by this private conference, the ignorant may be admoniſhed and inſtructed in neceſſarie matters: the other, that by this occaſion, the Goſpel of Chriſt, touching remiſſion of ſinnes, may be heard privately (the which Goſpel is the true Key of the Kingdome of heaven, and abſolution from ſinne) and that by the hearing of the Goſpel, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, faith may be either conceived, or confirmed. For, that we may truely repent, we thinke that there is nothing more ſure and certaine, then that of neceſſitie we ſhould have faith, to this end, that as the Goſpel of Chriſt doth declare it, ſo we may aſſuredly beleeve that our ſinnes are freely pardoned and forgiven for our Lord Ieſus Chriſt his ſake.</p>
                     <p>We are not ignorant, if we looke unto our workes, that we are not onely to doubt, but alſo to diſpaire of our ſalvation, becauſe that our workes, ſeeme they never ſo good, cannot ſtand upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſevere tribunall ſeate of God. Neither are we ignorant, that ſome doubt of the mercy and favour of God doth alwaies cleave to our fleſh, ſo long as we live in the body. But ſeeing that God doth promiſe unto us his free mercy for Chriſt his Sonnes ſake, and doth require of us, that we doe obediently beleeve the Goſpel of his Sonne, he there with alſo doth require, that we mortifie the doubting of the fleſh, and have a moſt aſſured affiance in his mercy, that we doe not accuſe his promiſe to be ſo full of deceit, as we are of doubting. And that we may conceive ſure confidence therein, he placed our ſalvation, not in the merits of our righteouſneſſe, which is unperfect, but onely in the merits of his Sonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: whoſe righteouſneſſe, as it is moſt perfect, ſo it is moſt firme and conſtant in the judgement of God, <hi>Mar. 1.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61072:89"/> favour of God toward us for Chriſt his ſake: therefore he will not have us to doubt of his favour towards us, but that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſure confidence thereof, <hi>Iohn 6. This is the worke of God, that ye beleeve in him, whom the Father hath ſent.</hi> If God require of us, that we beleeve in his Sonne, certainely he would not have us to doubt, but that we put our ſure confidence in him. <hi>Jam. 1.

For, as touching prayer, faſting, giving of almes, and ſuch like workes, we thinke that they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be performed, yet that they have a farre other uſe, then that they ſhould by their merits either ſatisfie God for our ſinnes or apply unto us the merite of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>SEeing that true confeſſion of ſinnes, and ſuch as hath it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from godlineſſe, can be performed of no man, whom his repentance and true ſorrow of minde doth not force thereunto, it cannot be wreſted out by any precept. Wherefore neither Chriſt himſelfe, nor the Apoſtles would command it. Therefore for this cauſe our Preachers doe exhort men to confeſſe their ſins, and there withall they ſhew what fruit ariſeth hereof, that a man ſhould ſecretly ſeeke for comfort, counſell, doctrine, inſtruction, and at the hands of a man, that is a Chriſtian, and wiſe, yet by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement they urge no man, but doe rather affirme, that ſuch commandements doe hinder godlineſſe. For that conſtitution of confeſſing ſinnes unto a Prieſt, hath driven infinite ſoules unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, and is ſubject to ſo many corruptions, that of late it ought to have beene abrogated, and without doubt had beene abrogated, if the governours of Churches of late time had burned with ſo great a zeale to remove away ſtumbling blocks, as in times paſt <hi>Neſtorius</hi> the Biſhop of Conſtantinople did burne, who did utterly aboliſh ſecret confeſſion in his Church, becauſe that a certaine noble woman, going often to Church, under pretence of doing the workes of repentance, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to have to doe with a Deacon. Infinit ſuch undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſinnes were committed every where. Moreover the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall lawes doe require that the hearer and judge of confeſſion ſhould be ſo holy, learned, wiſe, mercifull, that a man can hardly finde out, eſpecially among thoſe that are commonly appointed to heare confeſſions, to whom he might confeſſe himſelfe. And now the Schoolemen doe thinke, that it is better to confeſſe ſinnes to a laie man, then to that Prieſt, by whom we may not looke to be edified in godlineſſe. This is the ſumme: That confeſſion bringeth more hurt then profit, which ſound repentance and true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the minde for ſinnes committed doth not wring out. Therefore ſeeing this is the gift of God alone, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of our ſinnes, and be truely ſorrowfull for that wee have
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61072:90"/> ſinned, nothing, that may turne to ſalvation, can be done in this matter by commandements, as hath hitherto beene too too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt even by experience.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61072:90"/> through the grace of Chriſt alone, and not by any reſpect or merit of ours. For what is more plaine then that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith? <hi>All have ſinned, and are deſtitute of the glory of God, and are iuſtified</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> For Chriſt tooke upon himſelfe and bare the ſinnes of the world, and did ſatisfie the juſtice of God. God therefore is mercifull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſinnes for Chriſt alone that ſuffered and roſe againe, and doth not impute them unto us. But he imputeth the juſtice of Chriſt unto us for our owe: ſo that now we are not onely cleanſed<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> from ſinne, and purged, and holy, but alſo indued with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt, yea and acquitted from ſinne, death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: finally, we are righteous, and heires of eternall life.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> To ſpeake properly then, it is God alone that juſtifieth us, and that onely for Chriſt, by not imputing unto us our ſinnes, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting Chriſts righteouſneſſe unto us.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe we doe receive this juſtification, not by any works, but by faith in the mercy of God and in Chriſt: therefore we teach and beleeve with the Apoſtle that ſinnefull man is juſtified onely by faith in Chriſt, not by the law, or by any workes. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>We conclude that man is iuſtified by faith without the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 3. Rom. 4. Gen. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>workes of the law. If</hi> Abraham <hi>was iuſtified by workes, he hath whereof to boaſt, but not with God. For what ſaith the Scripture?</hi> Abraham <hi>beleeved God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But to him that worketh not, but beleeveth in him that iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe.</hi> And againe, <hi>You are ſaved by grace through faith, and that not of your ſelves:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>it is the gift of God. Not by workes, leſt any might have cauſe to boaſt, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore becauſe faith doth apprehend Chriſt our rigteouſneſſe, and doth attribute all to the praiſe of God in Chriſt, in this reſpect juſtification is attributed to faith chiefly becauſe of Chriſt, whom it receiveth, and not becauſe it is a worke of ours. For it is the gift of God. Now, that we doe receive Chriſt by faith, the Lord ſheweth at large, <hi>John</hi> 6. where he putteth eating for beleeving, and beleeving for eating. For as by eating we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive meate, ſo by beleeving we are made partakers of Chriſt. Therefore we doe not part the benefit of juſtification, giving part to the grace of God or to Chriſt, and a part to our ſelves, our charitie, workes, or merit, but we doe attribute it wholly to the praiſe of God in Chriſt, and that through faith. Moreover, our charitie and our works cannot pleaſe God if they be done of ſuch
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61072:91"/> are not juſt: wherefore we muſt firſt be juſt, before we can love or doe any juſt workes. We are made juſt (as we have ſaid) through faith in Chriſt, by the meere grace of God, who doth not impute unto us our ſinnes, but imputeth unto us the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt, yea and our faith in Chriſt he imputeth for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe unto us. Moreover the Apoſtle doth plainly derive love from faith, ſaying, <hi>The end of the commandement is love, proceeding</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>from a pure heart, a good conſcience, and a faith unfeigned.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this matter we ſpeake not of a fained; vaine, or dead faith, but of a lively, &amp; quickning faith, which for Chriſt (who is life, and giveth life) whom it apprehendeth, both is indeed, and is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a lively faith, and doth prove it ſelfe to be lively, by lively workes. And therefore <hi>James</hi> doth ſpeake nothing contrary to this our doctrine, for he ſpeaketh of a vaine and dead faith, which certain bragged of, but had not Chriſt living within them by faith. And <hi>James</hi> alſo ſaith, that <hi>workes doe iuſtifie,</hi> yet he is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<note place="margin">Iames 2.</note> to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (for then he were to be rejected) but he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Abraham</hi> did ſhew his lively and juſtifying faith by workes.

Nevertheleſſe, as was ſaid before, we doe not thinke, that we are ſaved by good workes, or that they are ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, that no man was ever ſaved without them. For we are ſaved by grace, and by the benefit of Chriſt alone. Workes doe neceſſarily proceede from faith: but ſalvation is improperly attributed to them, which is moſt properly aſcribed to grace. That ſentence of the Apoſtle is very notable, <hi>If by grace, then not of workes: for then grace were no</hi>

                     <p>Now the workes which we doe are accepted and allowed of God through faith, becauſe they which doe them pleaſe God by
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61072:92"/> faith in Chriſt, and alſo the workes themſelves are done by the grace of God through his holy Spirit. For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Of every nation, he that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſſe, is</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 10. Coloſſ. 1.</note>

And this we doe, with all diligence and earneſtneſſe that we can, inculcate and beate into mens mindes, ſharply reproving the ſlothfulneſſe and hypocriſie of all thoſe, who with their mouthes praiſe and profeſſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and yet with their ſhamefull life doe diſhonour the ſame, ſetting before their eies in this caſe Gods horrible threatnings, large promiſes, and bountifull rewards, and that by exhorting, comforting, and rebuking. For we teach, that God doth beſtow great rewards on them that doe good, according to that ſaying of the Prophet, <hi>Refraine thy voyce from weeping, becauſe thy worke</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 4. Mar. 5. &amp; 10.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall have a reward.</hi> In the Goſpel alſo the Lord ſaid, <hi>Reioyce, and be glad, becauſe your reward is great in the heavens.</hi> And, <hi>He that ſhall give to one of theſe little ones a cup of cold water, verily I ſay unto you he ſhall not looſe his reward:</hi> Yet we doe not attribute this reward, which God giveth, to the merit of the man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it, but to the goodneſſe or liberalitie, and truth of God, which promiſeth and giveth it: who although he owe nothing unto any, yet he hath promiſed to give a reward to thoſe that faithfully worſhip him, notwithſtanding that he doe alſo give them grace to worſhip him. Beſides there are many things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the majeſtie of God, and many unperfect things are found in the workes even of the Saints, and yet becauſe God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into favour, and imbrace the workes of them for Chriſts ſake, therefore he performeth unto them the promiſed reward. For otherwiſe, our righteouſneſſes are compared to a menſtruous<note place="margin">Iſa. 64.</note> cloath, yea, and the Lord in the Goſpel ſaith, <hi>When you have done all things that are commanded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants:</hi>

                        <hi>that which we ought to doe we have done.</hi> So that though we teach that God doth give a reward to our good deeds, yet withall we teach with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that <hi>God doth crowne in us, not our deſerts, but his owne gifts.</hi> And therefore whatſoever reward we receive, we ſay that it is a grace, and rather a grace then a reward: becauſe thoſe good things which we doe, we doe them rather by God,

Therefore we doe utterly reject all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means, whereby men doe thinke that they may be juſtified before God, and caſting away all opinion of vertues and merits, we doe altogether reſt in the onely obedience of Ieſus Chriſt, which is imputed to us, both that all our ſins may be covered, and alſo that we may obtaine grace before God. To conclude, we beleeve that we cannot finde where to reſt our ſelves, if we decline never ſo little from this foundation, but rather we ſhall be alwaies unquiet, becauſe we are not at peace with God, till we be certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that we are loved in Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe that in our ſelves we are worthy of all hatred.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve that by faith alone we are made partakers of this<note place="margin">Artic. 10.</note> righteouſneſſe, as it is written, He ſuffered, to purchaſe ſalvation for us, <hi>That whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh.</hi> And this is therefore done, becauſe the promiſes of life offered to us in him, are then applyed to our uſe, and made effectuall to us, when we doe imbrace them, nothing doubting but that we ſhall enjoy thoſe things, whereof the Lord by his owne mouth hath aſſured us. Therefore that righteouſneſſe, which we obtaine by faith, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon free promiſes, whereby the Lord doth declare and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that we are beloved of him.</p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:61072:98"/>
                  <p>We beleeve, that by the ſecret grace of the holy Ghoſt we<note place="margin">Artic. 21.</note> are indued with the light of faith, which is the free gift of God, and is proper to them alone, to whom it pleaſed God to give it, ſo that the faithfull have not whereof to boaſt in themſelves, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that rather they are more then double debters, becauſe they are preferred before others. And further we beleeve, that faith is given to the Elect, not that they might once onely be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right way, but rather that they may goe forward therein unto the end, becauſe that as the beginning is of God, ſo is alſo the accompliſhment.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve, that we, who by nature are the ſervants of ſin,<note place="margin">Artic. 22.</note> are regenerated unto a new life, by meanes of this ſame faith: and by this faith we receive grace to live holily, whiles we doe imbrace that Evangelicall promiſe, that the Lord will give unto us the holy Ghoſt.

                  <p>VVE beleeve that the holy Ghoſt, dwelling in out hearts; doth<note place="margin">Artic. 22.</note> beſtow upon us true faith, that we may attaine unto the knowledge of this ſo great a myſterie. The which faith doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Ieſus Chriſt with all his merits, doth challenge him unto it ſelfe as proper and peculiar, and doth ſeeke for nothing beſides him. For it is neceſſarie that either all thoſe things which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired unto our ſalvation be not in Chriſt, or if all be in him, that then he which by faith poſſeſſeth Ieſus Chriſt, hath alſo perfect ſalvation. Therefore it is an horrible blaſphemie againſt God, to affirme that Chriſt is not ſufficient, but that we have need of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes beſides him. For there upon it ſhould follow, that Chriſt is onely in part our Saviour. Wherefore we doe juſtly ſay with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>we are iuſtified by faith alone,</hi> or <hi>by faith without the workes of the law.</hi> Yet to ſpeake properly, we doe not meane, that faith by it ſelfe, or of it ſelfe doth juſtifie us, which is but onely as an inſtrument, whereby we apprehend Chriſt, which is our juſtice. Chriſt therefore himſelfe is our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which imputeth all his merits unto us: faith is but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, whereby we are coupled unto him, by a participation and communion of all his benefits, and whereby we are kept in that fellowſhip. So that all thoſe our effects are even more then enough unto us for our abſolution from all our ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve that all our felicity doth conſiſt in the remiſſion of<note place="margin">Artic. 23.</note> our ſinnes, which we have by Ieſus Chriſt, and that in it alone all our righteouſneſſe before God is contained, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, out of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> who declareth the happineſſe of thoſe men to whom God imputeth righteouſneſſe without works. And the<note place="margin">Rom. 4. Pſal. 32. Rom. 3</note> ſame Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>we are iuſtified by the redemption made in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> We therefore leanning upon this, as a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do yeeld all glory unto God, having a moſt baſe and humble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of our ſelves, knowing full well who and what manner of creatures we be in deed. Therefore we doe not preſume of our ſelves, or of any of our own merits, but being upholden by the only obedience of Chriſt crucified, we doe reſt altogether in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61072:99"/> the intent it may become ours, we beleeve in him. This righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe alone is all-ſufficient, both to cover all our iniquities, and alſo to make us ſafe and ſecure againſt all temptations. For it doth drive from our conſciences all feare, all horrour and dread, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might be hindred from approaching to God, and need not to imitate the example of our firſt father, who for feare flying from the preſence of God, went about to hide and cover himſelfe with fig-leaves. And truely if we truſting unto our ſelves never ſo little, or to any other creature, ſhould preſent our ſelves before the Majeſtie of God, it is certaine we ſhould by and by be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with it. Therefore every one of us muſt rather cry out with <hi>David,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Lord enter not into iudgement with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be iuſtified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We beleeve, that this true faith, being beilowed upon every<note place="margin">Artic. 24.</note> one of us by the hearing of the word of God, and the operation of the holy ſpirit, doth regenerate us, and make us as it were new men, raiſing us up, unto newneſſe of life, and ſetting us free from the bondage of ſin. Wherefore this juſtifying faith is ſo farre from withdrawing men from a right and holy kinde of living, or from making them more faint in godlineſſe, that on the contrary ſide no man, without it can performe any good thing, to this end, that God may have the glory, but men doe all things, either in regard of themſelves, or elſe for feare of juſt condemnation. Therefore it cannot be, that this holy faith ſhould be idle in a man. Neither doe we ſpeake of a vaine and dead faith, but only of that, which in the Scripture is ſaid, <hi>to worke by love,</hi> and which mooveth a man to exerciſe himſelfe in thoſe works, which God himſelfe hath commanded in his word. But theſe works which do come from the ſincere root of faith, are therefore good and acceptable unto God, becauſe they be ſanctified by his grace, but are nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>available to juſtifie us. For we are juſtified by ſaith in Chriſt, yea even before ſuch time, as we could bring forth any good worke, for our works before faith can no more be good, then the fruit of a good tree, before that the tree it ſelfe be good. Therefore we doe good works, yet not to merit any thing by them. For what is it poſſible for us to merit? Nay rather we, by reaſon of the good works, which we doe (if we doe any) are more bound unto God, then God unto us: For <hi>God is he, which worketh in us both the will and the deed, of his owne free mercie.</hi> Whereupon it is our duties alwayes to have a regard unto that, which is written, <hi>When
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61072:99"/> ye have done all that is commanded you, ſay, that we are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervants, for we have that which we ought to doe.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, we doe not hereupon denie, that God doth recompence good works in thoſe that be his, but we affirme that this recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence cometh of his meere grace, becauſe he crowneth his owne gifts in us. Yea although we doe good works, yet we doe not put any hope of ſalvation in them. For we are not able to bring forth any works, which are not polluted with the corruption of our fleſh, and for that cauſe be worthy of puniſhment: If it were granted, that we were able to bring forth any ſuch works, yet the bare remembrance of our ſinnes were ſufficient to remoove that worke out of the ſight of God. Therefore we ſhould alwaies ſtand in doubt, ſtaggering as it were this way, and that way, and our miſerable conſciences ſhould be in continuall torment, unleſſe they ſhould relie upon the onely merit of our Saviour Chriſt his death and paſſion, and reſt in it alone.</p>

                  <p>THat we might obtaine theſe benefits of Chriſts, namely, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, iuſtification, and life everlaſting, Chriſt hath given his Goſpel: wherein theſe benefits are layed forth unto us, as it is written in the laſt of <hi>Luke, that repentance ſhould be preached and remiſſion of ſinnes in his name among all nations.</hi> For whereas all men borne after a naturall manner have ſinne in them, and cannot truely ſatisfie the Law of God, <note n="*" place="margin">Locke the 1.

When as the Goſpell doth convict us of ſinne, our hearts thereby terrified muſt firmely beleeve, that there is given unto us freely for Chriſts ſake, that remiſſion of ſinnes, and juſtification by faith, by the which we muſt beleeve and confeſſe, that theſe things are given us for Chriſts ſake, who was made an oblation, and hath appeaſed the Fathers wrath for us. Notwithſtanding therefore that the Goſpell doe require repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet to the end that the remiſſion of our ſinnes may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and undoubted, it teacheth us, that remiſſion is given us freely, that is, that it doth not depend upon the condition of our owne worthineſſe, nor is given for any works that went before, nor for the worthineſſe of ſuch as follow after. For then ſhould remiſſion be uncertaine, if we ſhould thinke, that then onely, we obtaine
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61072:100"/> remiſſion of ſins, when we had deſerved it by our former works, or when our repentance were well worthy of it. For in true ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours the conſcience findeth no worke which it may oppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods wrath, but Chriſt is given and ſet forth unto us to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of God. This honour muſt not be transferred from Chriſt unto our own works, therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved freely.</hi> Againe, <hi>Therefore by faith, freely, that the promiſe might be ſure,</hi> that is, thus ſhall remiſſion be certaine, when we know that it dependeth not upon the condition of our unworthineſſe, but is given us for Chriſt his ſake. This is a ſure and neceſſary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all godly mindes, that are terrified with the conſcience of their ſins. And thus doe the holy fathers teach, and there is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſentence in Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> worthy the remembring, in theſe words. <hi>This God hath appointed, that he which beleeveth in Chriſt, ſhould be ſaved, without any worke, by faith alone, receiving the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes.</hi> Now this word <hi>Faith,</hi> doth not onely ſignifie a knowledge of the Hiſtory of Chriſt, but alſo to beleeve and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto this promiſe, that is proper unto the Goſpel, wherein remiſſion of ſinnes, juſtification, and life everlaſting are promiſed untous for Chriſts fake. For this promiſe alſo doth pertaine to the Hiſtory of Chriſt, even as in the Creed unto the Hiſtory is added this article, <hi>I beleeve the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And unto this one the other articles, touching the Hiſtory of Chriſt, are to be referred. For the benefit is the end of the Hiſtorie: therefore did Chriſt ſuffer, and riſe again, that for him remiſſion of ſins and everlaſting life might be given unto us.</p>

                     <p>ALſo they teach, that men cannot be juſtified before God by<note place="margin">Artic. 4.</note> their owne power, merits, or works, but are juſtified for Chriſts ſake through faith, when they beleeve that they are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto favour, and their ſins forgiven through Chriſt, who by his death hath ſatisfied for our ſins. This faith doth God impute for righteouſneſſe unto them before himſelfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and 4.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe Chriſt hath appointed the miniſterie of teaching<note place="margin">Artic. 5.</note> the Goſpel, which preacheth repentance and remiſſion of ſins: and the preaching of either of theſe is generall, and layeth open the ſinnes of all men, and promiſeth remiſſion of them unto all that beleeve: for to the end that remiſſion might not be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, out that all diſtreſſed mindes might know that they ought to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61072:100"/> beleeve, that remiſſion of ſinnes is undoubtedly granted unto them for Chriſt, and not for their owne merits or worthineſſe. All theſe doe certainly obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes. And when as we doe in this ſort comfort our ſelves by the promiſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and doe raiſe up our ſelves by ſaith, therewithall is the holy ſpirit given unto us. For the holy ſpirit is given, and is effectuall, by the word of God and by the Sacraments. When as we doe heare or meditate of the Goſpel, or doe receive the Sacraments, and comfort our ſelves by faith, therewithall the ſpirit of God is effectuall, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Gal. 3. That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt might be given to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi> And to the Corinthians. <hi>The Goſpel is the miniſterie of the ſpirit.</hi> And to the Romanes, <hi>Faith cometh by hearing.</hi> When as then we doe comfort our ſelves by faith, and are freed from the terrours of ſin by the holy ſpirit, our hearts doe conceive the other vertues, acknowledge truly the mercie of God, and conceive the true love and the true feare of God, truſt, and hope of Gods helpe, prayer, and ſuch like fruits of the ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Such therefore as teach nothing concerning this faith, whereby we receive remiſſion of ſinnes, but will have mens conſciences ſtand in doubt, whether they obtaine remiſſion or no, and do adde further, that this doubting is no ſinne, are juſtly condemned. And theſe alſo doe teach, that men may obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes for their own worthineſſe: but they doe not teach to beleeve, that remiſſion of ſinnes is given freely for Chriſt ſake. Here alſo are condemned thoſe phantaſticall ſpirits, which dreame that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is given, or is effectuall without the word of God. Which maketh them contemne the miniſterie of the Goſpel and Sacraments, and to ſeek illumination without the word of God, and beſides the Goſpel. And by this means they draw away mens mindes from the word of God unto their own opinions, which is a thing very pernicious and hurtfull. Such were in old time the Manichees, and Enthuſiaſts. And ſuch are the Anabaptiſts now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies. Theſe and ſuch like frenſies we doe moſt conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne.

                     <p>This obedience therefore pleaſeth God, not becauſe it ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the law, but becauſe the perſon that performeth it, is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled by Chriſt, through faith, and beleeveth that the reliques of ſinne which remaineth in him be pardoned. Wherefore we muſt alwaies hold that we doe obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes, and that a man is pronounced juſt, freely, for Chriſt, through faith. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward that this obedience towards the law doth alſo pleaſe God, and is accounted a kinde of juſtice and <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> deſerveth rewards.

                     <p>THat our adverſaries doe accuſe us to neglect the doctrine of good works, it is a manifeſt ſlander; for the books of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are extant, wherein they doe godly and profitably teach, touching good works, what works in every calling doe pleaſe God. And whereas in moſt Churches there hath been of a long time no word of the moſt ſpeciall works, namely, of the exerciſes of faith, and of the praiſe of ſuch works as pertaine to Civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but for the moſt part they ſpent all their Sermons in ſetting forth praiſes of humane traditions, and in commending ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes, faſtings, the ſtate of Monks. Fraternities, Pilgrimages, the worſhip of Saints, Roſiers, and other unprofitable ſervices, now by the goodnes of God the Church is reclaimed unto the true &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable worſhip, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God doth require &amp; approove. The Prophets do bewail this calamity of the Church in very vehement Sermons, that the true worſhip of God being forgotten, mens ceremonies and a wicked confidence in ceremonies ſhould have place the chiefe in the Church. From this error they revoke the Church
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61072:102"/> unto the true ſervice of God, and unto good works in deed. What can be more forceably ſpoken, then that Sermon in the 49 Pſalme. <hi>The God of Gods, the Lord hath ſpoken, and called the earth.</hi> Here God doth preach unto all mankinde, condemning their vaine truſt in ceremonies, and propoundeth another worſhip, giving them to underſtand, that he is highly diſpleaſed with them, that in tho Church doe ſo preach ceremonies, that they overturne the true worſhip of God. Many ſuch like Sermons are to be found in the Prophets, as <hi>Eſay, Cap.</hi> 58. and <hi>Zachar. 7. Michah. Cap.</hi> 6. and <hi>Hoſea</hi> cryeth, <hi>I will have mercie, and not ſacrifice: and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, rather then burnt offerings.</hi> And it is not unknown that many godly and learned men, have heretofore greatly wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the doctrine touching the comfort of conſciences, and the difference of works, had been more ſound. For both theſe parts of doctrine ought alwaies to be in the Church, namely, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of faith, for to inſtruct and comfort the conſciences, and alſo the doctrine that declareth which are good works indeed, and which is the true worſhip of God. As for our adverſaries, ſeeing that they doe corrupt the doctrine of faith, they cannot affoord any ſound comfort to the conſciences: for they will have men to ſtand in doubt of the remiſſion of their ſins and yet afterwards they bid men ſeeke remiſſion of ſin by their own works: they deviſe Monkeries, and other ſuch works, and then they aboliſh the true worſhip of God: for prayer and other ſpirituall exerciſes are laid aſide, when mens mindes are not eſtabliſhed in a ſure truſt in Chriſt. Moreover, their works of the ſecond table can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God, except faith goe with them. For this obedience that is but begun, and is unperfect, doth pleaſe God for Chriſt ſake alone. Thirdly, they debaſe the works commanded of God, and preferre mans traditions farre before them. Theſe they ſet out with moſt goodly titles, calling them the perfection of the Goſpel: but in the meane time, they ſpeake ſo coldly of the dutie of a mans calling, of magiſtracie, of marriage, &amp;c. that many grave men have doubted, whether theſe ſtates of life did pleaſe God or no. Therefore our Preachers have with great care and ſtudie ſet forth theſe both kindes of doctrine, teaching the Goſpel concerning faith, and adjoyning therewith a pure and holy doctrine of works.</p>

                     <p>FIrſt, touching Faith and Iuſtification, they teach thus. Chriſt hath fitly ſet downe the ſumme of the Goſpel, when as in the laſt of <hi>Luke</hi> he willeth, <hi>that repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhould be preached in his name.</hi> For the Goſpel <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 5. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</note> reproveth and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſinnes, and requireth repentance, and withall offereth remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes for Chriſt ſake, freely, not for our owne worthineſſe. And like as the preaching of repentance is generall, even ſo the promiſe of grace is generall, and willeth all men to beleeve and to receive the benefit of Chriſt, as Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are laden.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He is rich towards all, &amp;c.</hi> Albeit therefore that contrition in repentance be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet we muſt know that remiſſion of ſins was given unto us, and that we are made juſt of unjuſt, that is, reconciled or acceptable, and the ſonnes of God, freely, for Chriſt, and not for the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our Contrition, or of any other workes, which either goe before, or follow after. But this ſame benefit muſt be received by faith, whereby we muſt beleeve that remiſſion of ſinnes and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is given us for Chriſts ſake. This knowledge and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bringeth ſure conſolation unto troubled mindes, and how neceſſary it is for the Church, conſciences that have had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience can eaſily judge. There is in it no abſurditie, no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, no craftie deceit. <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the ſixt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. upon this confeſſion.</note> Here needeth no diſputations of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, or ſuch like: for the promiſe is generall, and detracteth nothing from good workes, yea rather it doth ſtirre up men unto faith and unto true good workes. For remiſſion of ſinnes is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from our workes, and attributed unto mercy, that it might be an undoubted benefit, not that we ſhould be idle, but much more, that we ſhould know how greatly our obedience doth pleaſe God even in this our ſo great infirmitie. Now for any man to deſpiſe or miſlike this doctrine, whereby both the honour of Chriſt is extolled, and moſt ſweet and ſure comfort offered unto godly mindes, and which containeth the true knowledge of Gods mercy, and bringeth forth the true worſhip of God and eternall life, it is more then Phariſaicall blindneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Before time when as this doctrine was not ſet forth, many fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conſciences aſſaied to eaſe themſelves by workes, ſome fled to a monaſticall life, others did chuſe out other workes, whereby to merit remiſſion of ſinnes and juſtification. But there is no ſure
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61072:103"/> comfort without this doctrine of the Goſpel, which willeth men to beleeve, that remiſſion of ſinnes and juſtification are freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us for Chriſts ſake, and this whole doctrine is appointed for the true conflict of a terrified conſcience. But we will adde ſome teſtimonies, <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 3. <hi>We are iuſtified freely, by his grace, through redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſus, whom God hath ſet forth, to be a reconciliation through faith in his bloud.</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but beleeveth in him that iuſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Epheſ. 2. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved, through faith, not of your ſelves.</hi> In theſe and ſuch like ſentences <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly teach, that remiſſion of ſinnes and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification are given us freely, and not for the worthineſſe of our workes. And in the 4. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he diſputeth at large, why this conſolation is needfull for us, for if the promiſe did depend upon the worthineſſe of our works, it ſhould be uncertain. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the end that we may have ſure and firme comfort againſt the feares of ſinne and death, and that our faith may ſtand faſt, it is needfull, that it leane onely upon the mercy of God, and not upon our worthineſſe. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Therefore it is by faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to grace, that the promiſe might be ſure.</hi> For our workes cannot be ſet againſt the judgement of God, according to that ſaying, <hi>If thou markeſt our iniquities, who ſhall indure it.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt is given for a Mediatour to us, and this honour is not to be transferred unto our workes.</p>
                     <p>When therefore we doe ſay, that <hi>we are iuſtified by faith,</hi> we doe not meane, that we are juſt for the worthineſſe of that vertue, but this is our meaning, that we doe obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes, and imputation of righteouſneſſe by mercy ſhewed us for Chriſts ſake. But now this mercy cannot be received, but by faith. And <hi>Faith</hi> doth not here ſignifie onely a knowledge of the hiſtory, but it ſignifieth a beliefe of the promiſe of mercy which is granted us through our Mediatour Chriſt Ieſus. And ſeeing that faith is in this ſort underſtood of a confidence or truſt of mercy, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and Saint <hi>James,</hi> doe not diſagree. For where <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Devils beleeve, and tremble,</hi> he ſpeaketh of an hiſtoricall faith, now this faith doth not juſtifie. For the wicked and the devill are cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the hiſtorie. But <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Faith is reckoned for righteouſneſſe,</hi> he ſpeaketh of a truſt and confidence of mercy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for Chriſts ſake: and his meaning is, that men are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced righteous, that is reconciled through mercy promiſed for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61072:103"/> Chriſts ſake, whom we muſt receive by faith. Now this novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this figurative ſpeech of Saint <hi>Paul, We are iuſtified by faith,</hi> will not offend holy mindes, if they underſtand that it is ſpoken properly of mercy, and that herein mercy is adorned with true and due praiſes. For what can be more acceptable to an afflicted and fearefull conſcience in great griefes, then to heare that this is the commandement of God, and the voyce of the Bridegroome Chriſt Ieſus, that they ſhould undoubtedly beleeve, that remiſſion of ſinnes or reconciliation is given unto them, not for their owne worthineſſe, but freely through mercy, for Chriſts ſake, that the benefit might be certaine? Now <hi>Iuſtification</hi> in theſe ſayings of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſignifie remiſſion of ſinnes, or reconciliation, or imputation of righteouſneſſe, that is, an accepting of the perſon. And herein we doe not bring in a new found opinion into the Church of God. For the Scripture doth ſet downe at large this doctrine touching faith, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth eſpecially handle this point in ſome of his Epiſtles: the holy Fathers doe alſo teach the ſame. For ſo ſaith <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his booke <hi>de vocat. Gent. If ſo be that Juſtification, which is by grace, were due unto former merits, ſo that it ſhould not be a gift of the giver, but a reward of the worker, the redemption by the blood of Chriſt would grow to be of ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and the prerogative of mans workes would not yeeld unto the mercies of God.</hi> And of this matter there be many diſputations in Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> And theſe are his words. <hi>Forſomuch as by the law God ſheweth to man his infirmitie, that flying unto his mercy by faith he might be ſaved. For it is ſaid, that he carrieth both the law and mercy in his mouth. The law to convict the proud: and mercy, to iuſtifie thoſe that are humbled. Therefore the righteouſneſſe of God through faith in Chriſt is revealed upon all that beleeve.</hi> And the Milevitan Synole writeth. <hi>Is not this ſuficiently declared, that the law worketh this, that ſinne ſhould be knowne, and ſo againſt the victory of ſinne, men ſhould flie to the mercy of God, which is ſet forth in his promiſes, that the promiſes of God, that is the grace of God, might be ſought unto for deliverance, and man might begin to have a righteouſneſſe, howbeit not his owne, but Gods?</hi>

                     <p>VVHen as we doe teach in our Churches the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie doctrine, and comfort of faith, we joyne there with the doctrine of good workes, to wit, that obedience unto the law
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61072:104"/> of God is requiſite in them that be reconciled. For the Goſpel preacheth newneſſe of life, according to that ſaying, <hi>I will put my lawes in their hearts:</hi> This new life therefore muſt be an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards God. The Goſpel alſo preacheth repentance, and faith cannot be, but onely in them, that doe repent, becauſe that faith doth comfort the hearts in contrition and in the feares of ſinne, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Being iuſtified by faith, we have peace.</hi> And of repentance he ſaith, <hi>Rom. 6. Our old man is crucified, that the body of ſinne might be aboliſhed, that we might no more ſerve ſinne.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Where will the Lord dwell? In a contrite and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, among good workes, the chiefeſt, and that which is the chiefeſt worſhip of God, is faith, which doth bring forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other vertues, which could never be in men, except their hearts had firſt received to beleeve. <hi>How ſhall they call on him, in whom they doe not beleeve?</hi> So long as mens mindes are in doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God heareth them or not, ſo long as ever they thinke that God hath rejected them, they doe never truely call upon God. But when as once we doe acknowledge his mercy through faith, then we flie unto God, we love him, we call upon him, hope in him, looke for his helpe, obey him in afflictions, becauſe we doe now know our ſelves to be the ſonnes of God, and that this our ſacrifice, that is, our afflictions, doth pleaſe God. Theſe ſervices doth Faith bring forth. Very well therefore ſaid <hi>Ambroſe, Faith is the mother of a good will, and of iuſt dealing.</hi> Our Adverſaries will ſeem very honourably to ſet out the doctrine of good works, and yet concerning theſe ſpirituall workes, to wit, faith, and the exerciſes of faith in prayer, and in all matters, counſels, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of this life, they ſpeake never a word. And indeed none can ever ſpeake well of theſe exerciſes if the conſciences be left in doubt, and if they know not that God requireth faith as a ſpeciall worſhip of his. And when as that huge ſhew of outward workes is caſt (as a myſt) before mens eyes, the mindes, eſpecially ſuch as be not well inſtructed, are led away from beholding theſe inward exerciſes. Now it is very requiſite, that men ſhould be taught and inſtructed, concerning theſe inward workes and fruits of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For theſe they be that make a difference betweene the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hypocrites. As for exernall worſhip, externall ceremonies, and other outward workes, the very hypocrites can performe them. But theſe ſervices and duties belong onely to the true
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61072:104"/> Church, true repentance, feare, faith, prayer, &amp;c. Theſe kindes of worſhip are eſpecially required, and commended in the Scripture, <hi>Pſal. 49. Offer unto God the ſacrifice of praiſe:</hi> and, <hi>Call on me in the day of trouble, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by this faith, which doth comfort the heart in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we doe receive the Spirit of God, who is given us to be our governour and helper, that we ſhould reſiſt ſinne and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and more and more acknowledge our owne weakeneſſe, and that the knowledge and feare of God, and faith may increaſe in us: wherefore our obedience to God and a new life ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in us, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We muſt be renewed to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God,</hi> that the new law may be wrought in us, and his Image, which hath created us, be renewed, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we teach alſo how this obedience, which is but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne onely and not perfect, doth pleaſe God. For in this ſo great infirmitie, and uncleanneſſe of nature, the Saints doe not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the law of God. The faithfull therefore have need of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that they may know how their ſlender and imperfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth pleaſe God. It doth not pleaſe him, as ſatisfying his law, but becauſe the perſons themſelves are reconciled and made righteous through Chriſt, and doe beleeve that their weakneſſe is forgiven them, as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>There is now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Albeit then that this new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is farre from the perfection of the law, yet it is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and is worthy of a reward, even becauſe that the perſons are reconciled. And thus we muſt judge of thoſe workes, which are indeed highly to be commended, namely <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 7. Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that they be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that they be the ſervice of God, and ſpirituall ſacrifices, and do deſerve a reward: Nevertheleſſe this confolation is firſt to be held touching the perſon, which is very neceſſary in the conflict of the confcience, to wit, that we have remiſſion of ſinnes freely by faith, and that the perſon is juſt, that is, reconciled, and an heire of eternall life through Chriſt, and then our obedience doth pleaſe God, according to that ſaying, <hi>Now ye are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi> For our workes may not be ſet againſt the wrath and judgement of God: But the terrours of ſinne and death muſt be overcome by faith and truſt in the Mediatour Chriſt, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. <hi>O death, I will be thy death.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is the will of the Father, which ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Sonne, and beleeveth in him, ſhould have life everlaſting.</hi> And Saint
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61072:105"/> Paul, <hi>Being iuſtified by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> And the Church alwaies prayed, <hi>for give us our treſpaſſes.</hi> And thus do the Fathers teach, concerning the weakneſſe of the Saints, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his expoſition of the 30. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deliver me in thy righteouſneſſe. For there is a righteouſneſſe of God, which is made ours, when it is given unto us. But therefore it is called the righteouſneſſe of God, leſt man ſhould thinke that he had a righteouſneſſe of himſelfe. For, as the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, To him that beleeveth in him that iuſtifieth the wicked, that is, that of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed maketh a righteous man, If God ſhould deale by the rule of the law, which is ſet forth unto us, he muſt needs be condemned: If God ſhould as it were deale by the rule propounded in the law, whom ſhould he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver? for he ſindeth all men to be ſinners. So ſaith</hi> Paul: <hi>All have ſinned, and ſtand in need of the glory of God. What is this to ſtand in neede of Gods glory? That he ſhould deliver thee, and not thou thy ſelfe. For thou canſt not deliver thy ſelfe: Thou haſt neede of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Why doſt thou vaunt thy ſelfe? what maketh thee to preſume of the law and of righteouſneſſe? Seeſt thou not that which doth ſight within thee? dost thou not beare one that ſtriveth, and confeſſeth his weakeneſſe, and deſireth aide in the battell? O miſerable man that I am? &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it may eaſily be perceived, how needfull this doctrine is for the Church, that men may know, that they doe not ſatisfie the law of God and yet may have true comfort, knowing how their imperfect obedience doth pleaſe God. This doctrine hath beene horribly darkned, and ſuppreſſed heretofore by certaine fond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, wherein unlearned men have imagined againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Scripture that they can fulfill the law of God, and that they are juſt through the fulfilling of the law, &amp;c. And that Monks are perfect, and doe performe more notable and worthy workes, then the law doth require. In the meane while there is not a word, how the Mediatour Chriſt is to be apprehended by faith: but they willed man to doubt, or elſe to truſt in his owne workes. But as touching this obedience, we doe teach, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the third obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. upon this confeſſion.</note> that they which commit mortall ſinnes are not juſt, becauſe God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth this obedience that we ſhould reſiſt ſinfull luſts. They then which ſtrive not againſt them, but obey them, contrary to the commandement of God, and do things againſt their conſciences, they are unrighteous, and doe neither retaine the holy ſpirit, nor faith, that is, confidence and truſt of Gods mercy. For confidence,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61072:105"/> which ſeeketh remiſſion of ſinnes, cannot ſo much as be in ſuch, as are delighted with their ſinnes, and remaine without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, this point is needfull alſo to be taught, by what means men may doe good workes. We ſhewed a little before how our workes doe pleaſe God. In this place we adde how they may be done. <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 8.

Obſervat.</note> Moreover, nature by it ſelfe is weake, and cannot without Gods helpe, ſtrengthen it ſelf to the performance of any ſpirituall works. And for that cauſe are men taught, that in the Goſpel the holy Spirit is promiſed, who ſhall aide and governe the mindes of them, who doe repent and beleeve the Goſpel. Wherefore in ſo great infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of nature, in the middeſt of theſe aſſaults of Satan, and in all dangers, faith muſt be exerciſed in calling upon God, even throughout our whole life, that we may continue alwaies in the faith, and in our obedience towards God. Therefore <hi>Zacharie,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will poure forth the ſpirit of grace, and of prayer, upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem.</hi> He calleth him the ſpirit of grace, becauſe the holy ſpirit doth confirme and comfort troubled mindes, and beareth record, that God is pleaſed with us.

                     <p>There is no doubt but true vertues are the gifts of God, ſuch as are, faith, cleereneſſe of judgement in diſcerning of points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, courage of minde, ſuch as is requiſite in them which teach and profeſſe the Goſpel, true care and paines in governing of Churches, true humilitie, not to hunt after preferment, not to be puft up with popular praiſe, nor caſt downe with their diſliking and ill will, true charitie, &amp;c. Theſe Princely vertues <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Gods gifts, <hi>Romans 12 Having divers gifts, according to the grace that is given us.</hi> And of theſe he ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians, Theſe things worketh one and the ſame ſpirit, diſtributing to every one, according, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Vnto theſe gifts we muſt joyne our exerciſe which may both preſerve the ſame, and deſerve an increaſe of them: according to the ſaying: <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given.</hi> And it is notably ſaid of <hi>Auguſtine, Love deſerveth an increaſe of love,</hi> to wit, when it is put in uſe. For good workes have rewards, as in this life, ſo alſo after this life, in the everlaſting life. Now becauſe that the Church in this life is ſubject to the croſſe, and to the death of the body, therefore many rewards are deferred untill the life to come, which though it be undoubtedly beſtowed through mercy for Chriſts ſake on thoſe which are juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, yet there is alſo a rewarding of good workes, according to that ſaying, <hi>Your reward is great it heaven.</hi> By this it is evident, that the doctrine of good workes, is through the goodneſſe of God purely and truely taught in our Churches. How full of obſcuritie and confuſion the doctrine of good workes was in former times, all godly mindes know full well. There was none that put men in minde of the difference of mans traditions and the law of God: none that taught, how good workes did pleaſe God, in this ſo great infirmitie of ours. To be briefe, there was not one word of faith, which is moſt needfull unto remiſſion of ſinnes. But now that theſe maters be opened and unfolded, godly conſciences lay hold of comfort, and of certaine hope of ſalvation, and doe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand which is the true worſhip and ſervice of God, and know how it pleaſeth God, and how it doth merit at his hands.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>This article is thus ſet downe in another Edition.</head>
                     <p>OVr Divines are falſly accuſed to forbid good workes. For their writings extant upon the tenne Commandements, and others of the like argument, doe beare witneſſe, that they have to good purpoſe taught, concerning every kinde of life and duties, what trades of life, and what workes in every Calling doe pleaſe God. Of which things Preachers in former times taught little or nothing, onely they did urge certain childiſh and needleſſe works. As keeping of holy dayes, ſet faſts, fraternities, pilgrimages, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Saints, Friaries, Monkeries, and ſuch traſh: whereof our adverſaries having had warning, they doe now forget them, and doe not preach ſo concerning theſe unprofitable workes, as they were went to doe. Beſides they beginne now to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith, which they were wont to paſſe over with ſilence.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61072:106"/> But yet they ceaſe not to obſcure and darken this doctrine of faith, while they leave the conſcience in doubt and would have men to merit remiſſion of ſinnes, by their workes, and teach not that we doe by faith alone undoubtedly receive remiſſion of ſinnes for Chriſts ſake. When as therefore the doctrine of faith, which ſhould be eſpecially above others taught in the Church, hath been ſo long unknowne, as all men muſt needs grant, that there was not a word of the righteouſneſſe of faith in all their Sermons, and that the doctrine of workes onely was uſuall in the Churches, for this cauſe our Divines did thus admoniſh the Churches. Firſt that our workes cannot reconcile God unto us, or deſerve remiſſion of ſinnes, grace, and juſtification, at his hands. But this we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by faith whiles we beleeve that we are received into favour for Chriſts ſake who alone is appointed the Mediatour and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour by whom the Father is reconciled to us. He therefore that truſteth by his workes to merit grace, doth deſpiſe the merit and grace of Chriſt, and ſeeketh by his owne power, without Chriſt, to come unto the Father, whereas Chriſt hath ſaid expreſly of himſelfe, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> This Doctrine of Faith is handled by <hi>Paul</hi> almoſt in every Epiſtle, <hi>Epheſ. 2. Ye are ſaved freely by faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God, not of workes, &amp;c.</hi> And leſt any here ſhould cavill, that we bring in a new found interpretation, this whole cauſe is underpropped with teſtimonies of the Fathers. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth in many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes defend grace and the righteouſneſſe of faith againſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of workes. The like doth <hi>Ambroſe</hi> teach in his book, <hi>De vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. Gent.</hi> and elſe where: for thus he ſaith in the forenamed place, <hi>The redemption made by the blood of Chriſt would be of ſmall account, and the prerogative of mans workes would not give place to the mercy of God, if the iuſtification which is by grace, were due to merits going before, ſo as it ſhould not be the liberalitie of the giver, but the wages or hire of the labourer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This doctrine though it be contemned of the unskilfull ſort, yet the godly and fearefull conſcience doth finde by experience, that it bringeth very great comfort: becauſe that the conſciences cannot be quieted by any workes, but by faith alone, when as they beleeve aſſuredly, that God is appeaſed towards them for Chriſts ſake, as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>Rom. 5. Being iuſtified by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> This doctrine doth wholly belong to the conflict of a troubled conſcience, and cannot be well underſtood, but
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61072:107"/> where the conſcience hath felt a conflict. Wherefore all ſuch as have had no experience thereof, and all that are prophane men, which dreame that Chriſtian righteouſneſſe is naught elſe, but a civill and phyloſophicall juſtice, are evill judges of this matter. In former ages mens conſciences were vexed with the doctrine of works, they never heard any comfort out of the Goſpel. Whereupon conſcience drave ſome into Monaſteries, hoping there to merit favour by a monaſticall life. Others found out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes, whereby to merit favour, and to ſatisfie for ſinne. There was very great need therefore to teach this doctrine of faith in Chriſt, and after ſo long time to renue it, to the end that fearefull conſciences might not want comfort, but might know, that grace and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes and juſtification were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and received by faith in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Another thing, which we teach men, is, that in this place the name of <hi>Faith</hi> doth not onely ſignifie a bare knowledge of the hiſtory, which may be in the wicked, and as in the Devill, but it ſignifieth a faith, which beleeveth, not onely the hiſtory, but alſo the effect of the hiſtorie, to wit, the article of remiſſion of ſinnes, namely, that by Chriſt we have grace, righteouſneſſe, and remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes. Now he that knoweth, that the father is mercifull to him through Chriſt, this man knoweth God truely: he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that God hath a care of him, he loveth God, and calleth upon him: In a word, he is not without God in the world, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are. As for the Devils, and the wicked, they can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this article of the remiſſion of ſinnes. And therefore they hate God as their enemie, they call not upon him, they looke for no good thing at his hands. After this manner doth <hi>Auguſtine</hi> admoniſh his Reader touching the name of faith, and teacheth, that this word faith, is taken in Scriptures, not for ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as is in the wicked, but for a truſt and confidence, which doth comfort and cheere up diſquieted mindes.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, our Divines doe teach, that it is requiſite to doe good workes, not for to hope to deſerve grace by them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the will of God that we ſhould doe them. And becauſe that the holy ſpirit is received by faith our hearts are preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and doe put on new affections, ſo as they are able to bring forth good workes. For ſo ſaith <hi>Ambroſe, Faith is the breeder of a good will and of good actions.</hi> For mans powers, without the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit, are full of wicked affections, and are weaker then that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61072:107"/> they can doe any good deed before God. Beſides, they are in the devils power, who driveth men forward into divers ſinnes, into profane opinions, and into very hainous crimes. As was to be ſeene in the Philoſophers, who aſſaying to live an honeſt life, could not attaine unto it, but defiled themſelves with open and groſſe faults. Such is the weakeneſſe of man, when he is without faith and the holy Spirit, and hath no other guide, but the naturall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of man. Hereby every man may ſee that this doctrine is not to be accuſed, as forbidding good works, but rather is much tobe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, becauſe it ſheweth after what ſort we muſt doe good workes. For without faith the nature of man can by no meanes performe the workes of the firſt and ſecond table. Without faith it cannot call upon God, hope in God, beare the croſſe, but ſeeketh helpe from man, and truſteth in mans helpe. So it commeth to paſſe that all luſts and deſires, and all humane deviſes and counſels doe beare ſway, ſo long as faith and truſt in God is abſent. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Without me ye can doe nothing.</hi> Iohn 15. and the Church ſingeth, <hi>Without thy power there is naught in man, and there is nothing but that which is hurtfull.</hi>

                     <p>VVE ſaid before that theſe controverſies doe pertaine to the interpreting of two Articles of the Creed, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the remiſsion of ſinnes,</hi> and, <hi>I beleeve the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church.</hi> Neither doe we ſpeake of not neceſſary or light things. It is moſt neceſſary, that in the Church the doctrine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinne ſhould be propounded, and that men ſhould know what ſinne is, and that there ſhould be an evident difference betweene politicall judgements, and the judgement of God. But ſeeing our adverſaries doe not teach aright, what ſinne is, they confirme in men an evill ſecuritie, and many falſe opinions. Againe, what can be more miſerable, then either to obſcure, or to be ignorant of this great benefit, namely the remiſſion of ſinnes, and deliverance from eternall death? ſeeing that there is no difference betwixt the Church and other men, when as the light is extinguiſhed, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning free remiſſion of ſinnes, for the Sonnes ſake, and concerning Faith, whereby remiſſion muſt be received: neither is there any other comfort drawing us backe from eternall death, neither can
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61072:108"/> there be any true Invocation, without this comfort: and God himſelfe hath ſo often commanded, that his Son ſhould be heard, and the Goſpel kept, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is a wonderfull decree brought forth out of the ſecret counſell of the Godhead, when it was hid from all creatures; therefore it is moſt neceſſary, that the true doctrine, touching remiſſion of ſinnes, ſhould be kept undefiled.</p>
                     <p>But in all ages, even from our firſt fathers time, the devils have ſcattered ſubtill deluſions, againſt the true doctrine, concerning the Sonne of God, and eſpecially in this article, whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God hath oftentimes refuted good teachers being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine raiſed up, that the Church might not utterly periſh. <hi>Adam, Seth, Noe, Sem, Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob,</hi> and others after them, did ſhew the true difference, betwixt the Church of God and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, and taught that to the Church was given the promiſe, touching the Mediatour the Sonne of God, and touching remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, and that this remiſſion is to be received freely, for the Mediatours ſake: And they tied Invocation to this God, which had manifeſted himſelfe by giving a promiſe, concerning the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, and they had externall rites given them of God, which were ſignes of the promiſe, and the ſinewes of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Congregation. Theſe rites did a great part of the multitude imitate, omitting the doctrine of the promiſes and faith: and when they had deviſed this perſwaſion, that men by obſerving theſe rites might deſerve remiſſion of ſins, they heaped up many ceremonies, and by little and little boldneſſe went ſo far (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it cometh to paſſe) that divers men deviſed divers gods. So the heathen departed from the true Church of God, and from the knowlege of the true God, and the promiſe of the Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>The ſame thing alſo hapned after <hi>Moſes</hi> his time. Ceremonies were appointed for this cauſe, that they ſhould be admonitions of the Mediatour, of the Doctrine of Faith, of free remiſſion for the Mediatours ſake. But they feigned that ſinnes were forgiven for thoſe rites and ſacrifices, and by this ſuperſtition they heaped up ſacrifices, and forgot the Mediatour, and were without true comfort, and without true invocation. The ſame thing hapned alſo after the Apoſtles time, the light of the Goſpel being loſt, wherin is propounded free remiſſion for the Mediatours ſake, and that to be received by Faith. They ſought remiſſion by Monaſticall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, by ſingle life, by divers obſervations, by the offering in the Maſſe, by the interceſſion of dead men, and many monſtrous
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61072:108"/> ſuperſtitions were deviſed, as the hiſtories of the whole Church which ſucceeded the Apoſtles doe declare. Againſt theſe errors the infinite mercy of God hath oftentimes reſtored the voyce of the Goſpel: And as among the people of Iſrael he did often raiſe up Prophets, which ſhould purge the doctrine diligently; ſo in the Church, after the Apoſtles time, when the writings of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and the ſuperſtition of the people had corrupted the purity of the Goſpel, yet notwithſtanding, as in a myſt, the light of the Goſpel was again kindled by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and him followed <hi>Proſper, Maximus,</hi> and others, who reproved the falſe opinions touching this Article. Afterward when the Monkes were ſprung up, and that opinion, which feigneth men to merit by their works, was a freſh ſpread abroad, yet there was ſome of a better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although they added ſtubble to the foundation: as <hi>Huge, Bernard, Gilbert, William</hi> of <hi>Paris, Tauler, Ambroſe, Weſell,</hi> and others in other places. And now by the voyce of <hi>Luther,</hi> the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel is more cleered, and more evidently reſtored, and the Lambe ſhewed unto us, as the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God, that taketh away the ſinnes of the World. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in the Sonne, hath eternall life: he that beleeveth not, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> The ſame voyce of the Goſpel our Churches doe publiſh, and that without corruption: and we doe diſcerne that diſcipline, or righteouſneſſe, which a man not rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate may performe, from the righteouſneſſe of faith, and that newneſſe, whereof the Goſpel doth preach.</p>
                     <p>We ſay that all men are to be reſtrained by diſcipline, that is, by that righteouſnes, which even the unregenerate ought, &amp; after a ſort may performe, which is an obedience in externall actions, according to all the commandements of God appertaining to all men. <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> Becauſe that God left this libertie in man after his fall, that the outward members might after a ſort obey reaſon and the will, in ſtirring up or omitting outward motions: as, <hi>Achilles</hi> may draw his ſword, or put it up into the ſheath: <hi>Scipio</hi> may reſtraine his members, ſo that he meddle not with another mans wife, as in their place theſe things are truely and copiouſly declared. Now it is moſt certaine, that this diſcipline is commanded of God, and that the breaking thereof is puniſhed with preſent and eternall puniſhments, even in thoſe which are not converted unto God, according to thoſe ſayings, <hi>The law was made for the uniuſt. He that taketh the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Fornicatours
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61072:109"/> and adulterers the Lord will iudge.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Wee unto thee which ſpoileſt, becauſe thou ſhalt be ſpoiled.</hi> And although all men ought to governe their manners by this diſcipline, and God doth ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly command that all kingdomes ſhould defend this diſcipline, and he by horrible puniſhments doth declare his wrath againſt this outward contumacie: yet this externall diſcipline, even where it is moſt honeſt, is not a fulfilling of the law, neither doth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve remiſſion of ſinnes, neither is it that righteouſneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are accepted before God, nor that light ſhining in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of men, as righteouſneſſe ſhined in us in our creation, or as new righteouſneſſe ſhall ſhine in us in the life eternall. But all this diſcipline, is an externall government, ſuch as it is, like unto the leafe of a figge tree, where with our firſt parents after their fall did cover their nakedneſſe: neither doth it any more take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſinne, and the corruption of nature and death, then thoſe figge leaves did. Hence it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo often cry out, that ſinne is not taken away by the law, <hi>Rom. 3. By the workes of the law no fleſh ſhall be iuſtified in his ſight.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 8. When it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the law to iuſtifie, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Gal. 2. If righteouſneſſe doth come by the law, then Chriſt died in vaine.</hi> And <hi>Tit. 3. Not by the workes of righteouſneſſe, which we have done, but according to his mercy he hath ſaved us.</hi> And it is a reproch unto the Sonne of God, to imagine that any our workes are merits, or the price of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, and that they are propitiations for ſinnes. Therefore we doe openly condemne thoſe Phariſaicall and Pelagian doting dreames, which feigne that that diſcipline is a fulfilling of the law of God: alſo that it doth deſerve remiſſion, either of congruity, or of condignity, or that it is a righteouſneſſe, whereby men are made acceptable to God.</p>

                     <p>Seeing that the minde is raiſed up by this faith, it is certain that remiſſion of ſinnes, reconciliation, and imputing of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is given for the merit of Chriſt alone, and that Chriſt is effectuall in us, and doth by his holy ſpirit quicken the beleveers, and deliver us from eternall death, and withall make us heires of eternall life.

We conclude that man is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, without the workes of the law.</hi> Alſo, <hi>we are iuſtified freely by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood.</hi> And <hi>Acts 10.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61072:109"/> that all that beleeve in him, ſhall receive remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the words are knowne and manifeſt. <hi>Faith</hi> doth ſignifie not onely the knowledge of the (hiſtorie for that is alſo in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>The devils doe beleeve, and tremble</hi>) but it doth ſignifie, to embrace all the Articles of Faith, and among thoſe this article, <hi>I do beleeve the remiſsion of ſinnes,</hi> neither doe I beleeve that it is onely given to others, but to me alſo. This faith is alſo a confidence, reſting in the Mediatour, according to that, <hi>Being iuſtified by faith, we have peace.</hi> So that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of faith, which conſenting to all the articles of the Creed, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and imbrace the promiſe: for it joyneth together faith and the promiſe, <hi>Rom. 4.

                     </p>
                     <p>In expounding the word <hi>Iuſtified,</hi> it is uſually ſaid, <hi>To be Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> doth ſignifie, of unrighteous to be made righteous, which being rightly underſtood, doth agree alſo to our purpoſe. Of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous to be made righteous, that is, acquitted from the guilt, for the Sonne of God his ſake, that is, laying hold by faith upon Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>who is our righteouſneſſe</hi> (as <hi>Jeremie</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> doe ſay) becauſe that by his merit we have remiſſion, and God doth impute his righteouſneſſe to us, and for him doth account us juſt, and by giving his holy Spirit, doth quicken and regenerate us, as it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn 5. This is life in his Sonne: He that hath the Sonne, hath eternall life: he that hath not the Sonne of God, hath not life.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 3. That he may be iuſt, and a iuſtifier,</hi> And although newneſſe is withall begun, which ſhall be perfect in the life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, whereunto we are redeemed, yet neither for the new quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor for any works, is any man in this life made juſt, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and heire of eternall life, but onely for the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours ſake, who ſuffered, roſe againe, reigneth, and prayeth for us, ſhadowing and quickning us. For although vertues are here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, yet be they ſtill imperfect, and the reliques of ſinne do ſtick in us. Therefore we muſt hold this comfort, that the perſon is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Sonne of God his ſake, his righteouſneſſe being impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom. 4. Abraham beleeved God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Bleſſed are they, whoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities be forgiven, and whoſe ſins be covered.</hi> Therefore this ſaying muſt be underſtood correlatively, <hi>We are iuſtified by faith,</hi> that is, we are juſtified by confidence in the Son of God, not for our quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but becauſe he is the reconciler, in whom the heart doth reſt in

                     </p>
                     <p>Here alſo we muſt ſpeake of the excluſive member. <hi>Paul</hi> doth often repeat the word <hi>Freely,</hi> by which it is moſt certaine, that the condition of our merits is excluded.

For, although contrition and many other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are together with Faith or with this confidence kindled in us, yet theſe vertues are not the cauſe, or the merit of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, neither doth the perſon pleaſe God in regard of them, according to that ſaying, <hi>No man living ſhall be iuſtified in thy ſight:</hi> but the perſon hath remiſſion, and doth certainly pleaſe God, by reaſon of the Mediatour, who muſt be apprehended by faith, as it is ſaid, <hi>Eph. 3. By whom we have boldneſſe, and entrance with confidence, by faith in him.</hi> This whole doctrine is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the true converſion and daily invocation of the godly. When we are in great feare by the knowledge of the wrath of God, this one comfort is firme and ſure, to flie to the Son of God, who faith, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are laden, and I will refreſh you.</hi> Alſo, <hi>As I live, I will not the death of a ſinner, but that he returne and live.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Grace aboundeth more then ſinne.</hi> In theſe griefes if man be taught, to doubt of the remiſſion of ſinnes, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row will have the upper hand, and then follow moſt grievous murmurings againſt God, and deſperation, and eternall death: but if man be caught, that doubting is to be overcome by faith, then ſhall he underſtand, that by the word <hi>Faith,</hi> is not onely ſignified the knowledge of the ſtory: he ſhall know that confidence doth relie upon the only Mediator, and he ſhall perceive what is meant by theſe words, Freely, for the Mediatours ſake, remiſſion is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by faith alone, and ſo the perſon is made acceptable.</p>
                     <p>This wraſtling hath at all times inſtructed ſome. For though <hi>Origen,</hi> and many other writers and ſententiaries have brought forth an impure kind of doctrine, yet in <hi>Auguſtine</hi> &amp; certain others we reade divers ſentences which ſhew, that they alſo received comfort out of theſe true fountains. Who although they do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſpeak unproperly, or things unlike, becauſe they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what negligent in ſpeaking, yet we may eaſily gather what
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61072:110"/> was their perpetuall judgement, if we will judge aright. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> upon the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. ſaith. <hi>Who be happie? not they in whom God ſhall not finde ſins, for thoſe he findeth in all men. For all men have ſinned, and are deſtitute of the glory of God. Therefore if ſinnes be found in all men, it is evident, that none are happie, but thoſe whoſe ſins be forgiven. This therefore the Apoſtle did thus commend:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>beleeved God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Here certainly <hi>Auguſtine</hi> by faith doth underſtand confidence, which receiveth remiſſion of ſins: and that which is ſaid in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi> and in <hi>Paul,</hi> he doth altogether underſtand it, as we expound it. And in his booke, <hi>De ſpiritu &amp; litera,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>By the law we feare God, and by faith we flie to his mercie. Bernard</hi> in his Sermon, <hi>De Annunciatione,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Firſt of all it is neceſſarie to beleeve, that thou canſt not have remiſſion of ſins, but by the mercie of God. But adde thereunto, that thou maiſt alſo beleeve this, that through him thy ſins be forgiven thee. This is the witneſſe which the holy Ghoſt doth give in our heart, ſaying: Thy ſins be forgiven thee. For ſo doth the Apoſtle thinke, that a man is iuſtified freely by faith.</hi> In this ſentence the judgement of our Churches is plainly and properly alleadged, and like teſtimonies are to be found in this author. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> alſo, in his Sermon of Humilitie doth moſt properly ſet forth our judgement, in theſe words: <hi>He that reioyceth, let him reioyce in the Lord, ſaying, that Chriſt is made unto us of God, wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, He that reioyceth, let him reioyce in the Lord. For this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſound reioycing in God, when as a man is not puffed up by reaſon of his own righteouſneſſe, but doth acknowledge that he doth ſtand in need of the true righteouſneſſe, and that he is iuſtified by faith alone in Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore that by this which hath been ſpoken it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, what the word <hi>Faith</hi> doth ſignifie, in this propoſition, <hi>We are iuſtified by Faith,</hi> hereupon we may underſtand, that the Monks and others doe dangerouſly erre, which doe command thoſe that are turned to God, to doubt whether they doe pleaſe God. This common errour of doubting is evidently refuted by theſe words, <hi>Being iuſtified by Faith, we have peace with God.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Therefore is righteouſneſſe of faith, that the promiſe might be ſure.</hi> For ſo long as mens hearts are tormented with doubting, they flie from God, they doe not reſt in God, nor call upon him: and the promiſe becometh unto them but a vaine ſound, becauſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61072:111"/> they give not conſent unto it. To conclude, it is the eternall and immutable commandement of God, that we ſhould beleeve in the Son of God, according to this ſaying, <hi>The ſpirit ſhall convince the world of ſinne, becauſe they beleeve not in me.</hi> Alſo 1 <hi>Joh. 5. He that beleeveth not God, maketh him a lyer.</hi> Now it is a fooliſh ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, when they ſay, that we muſt doubt, in reſpect of our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and not in reſpect of mercie. For the promiſe was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given, therefore the Son of God was appointed our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, becauſe we are unworthy: and that for his ſake, having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, being raiſed up againe, and now making interceſſion for us, and dwelling in us, and cloathing us with his righteouſneſſe, the Father might undoubtedly be mercifull to this miſerable lumpe of ours; being unworthy, and full of filthineſſe: according to that ſaying, <hi>There is now no condemation to them which walke in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Alſo it is abſurd which they ſay, that we muſt doubt, by reaſon of our unworthineſſe. For we are not to doubt, whether our unworthineſſe doe diſpleaſe God, but with true ſighes let us confeſſe that we are unworthy, &amp; let us lay to the promiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto God hath commanded us to aſſent. Neither is that ſaying, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. fitly applyed to this doubting, <hi>Man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love, or of hatred.</hi> It is madneſſe to imagine that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhould have any ſuch meaning, that neither the juſt, nor the unjuſt ought to determine with themſelves, whether they pleaſe or diſpleaſe God, ſeeing it is moſt certaine, that they, which perſevere in wicked deeds againe their conſcience, doe diſpleaſe God. But <hi>Salomon</hi> doth withdraw us from externall ſhews to the word of God: as though he ſhould ſay: Doe not determine with thy ſelfe, that by reaſon of thy proſperitie thou art in favour with God, or by reaſon of thy adverſitie thou art out of favour with him. <hi>Alexander</hi> doth not therefore pleaſe God, becauſe he is a Conquerour, and enjoyeth a large Empire. Let not <hi>Iob</hi> in his calamitie, nor <hi>David</hi> in his exile thinke that they be forſaken of God, becauſe they be miſerable; let them not judge according to theſe events or outward ſhews, but by the word of God: and then even in the middeſt of our miſerie we ſhall receive this comfort, <hi>As I live, I will not the death of a ſinner, &amp;c. God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne, that every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in him ſhould not periſh, &amp;c.</hi> To conclude, This errour of doubting, is altogether heatheniſh, and doth aboliſh the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and in true converſion taketh away comfort from them that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61072:111"/> feele the wrath of God. Men are rather to be taught, that this is undoubtedly the voice of the Goſpel, that we ſhould beleeve the Sonne of God, and be aſſured, that grace doth abound much more then ſinne: and therefore let us withſtand doubting, by wreſtling get the upper hand, and by faith overcome it, that we may have acceſſe to God: invocate him, and give him thanks. Theſe chiefe points of worſhip are fearefully hindred, when mens mindes are ſhaken with the waves of doubting, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth. Hereof it is evident, why it is neceſſary, that the Decree of the Tridentine Councell, which confirmeth the errour of doubting, ſhould be reprooved. Alſo, by all that which hath been ſaid, it may be underſtood, that we doe juſtly finde fault with that Synecdoche, whereby ſome interpret <hi>Pauls</hi> words after this ſort, <hi>We are iuſtified by Faith,</hi> that is, by a formed love, as they ſpeake. For they underſtand the word faith onely of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and thinke that this is the meaning; <hi>We are iuſtified by Faith,</hi> that is, we are prepared to righteouſneſſe, that is, to other vertues, to wit, obedience and fulfilling of the Law. So this is it onely which they ſay. Man is righteous for his own vertues: then they will him to doubt, whether he be furniſhed with thoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, whereof they ſpeake.</p>
                     <p>Now we have declared before, that by Faith is ſignified a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence reſting in the Sonne of God the Reconciler, for whom we are received, and doe pleaſe God, not for our vertues, or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Law. And ſeeing that in this ſame comfort, the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whereby we doe reſt in the Sonne of God, is indeed a motion, kindled by the holy Ghoſt, whereby the heart is quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and freed from eternall death, this converſion is called regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Ioh. 3. Except a man be borne againe of water, and of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> And now man is made indeed the dwelling place of God, who is effectuall in him: as it is ſaid, <hi>Ioh. 14. If any man love me, he will keepe my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and will dwell with him.</hi> The eternall Father and the Son, by the holy Ghoſt, doe quicken our hearts, when as by faith they are raiſed up in this comfort, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Galat. 3. That ye might receive the promiſe of the ſpirit through faith.</hi> Therefore we doe not ſpeake of an idle faith: and the unskilfull are deceived, whiles they thinke that remiſſion of ſinnes doth happen to ſuch as are idle, without a certain motion of the minde, without wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and without a feeling comfort of in true griefes, in that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61072:112"/> age which now is able to underſtand the voice of doctrine, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſaying, <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> And becauſe that in repentance we propound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto the conſcience, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 6. obſervation upon the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> confeſſ.</note> we doe not here adde queſtions of predeſtination or of election, but we lead all Readers to the word of God, and exhort them to learne the will of God out of his word, as the eternall Father by expreſſe voice commanded. <hi>Heare him.</hi> Let them not looke for other revelations.</p>

                     <p>THE whole benefit of the Son of God is to be conſidered: for he will ſo take away ſinne and death, and deliver us from the kingdome of the Devill, that ſinne being altogether aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and death vanquiſhed, he may reſtore unto us eternall life, wherein God may communicate unto us his wiſdome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and joy, and wherein God may be all in all. This great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit he doth begin in this miſerable lumpe of ours, in this life, as it is written, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. If ſo be we ſhall be found cloathed, and not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> Alſo <hi>Matth. 10.

Theſe rules are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times repeated, as <hi>Galat. 5.

                     <p>IT is the will of God, that Faith and works be governed by his word. Therefore we muſt keepe the rule, touching good works both internall and externall, contained in the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, which doe pertaine to us, as it is ſaid, <hi>Ezech. 23. Walke ye in my commandements.</hi> And theſe internall and externall works doe then become the worſhip of God, when they be done in faith, and are referred to this end, that God by this obedience may be glorified. Now we have ſhewed before, that even the unregenerate may performe this externall obedience or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: as <hi>Cicero</hi> liveth honeſtly, and for his pains in government deſerveth well of all mankinde: but his minde is full of doubts, touching the Providence of God, neither doth he know, nor ſpeake unto the true God in invocation, neither doth he know the promiſes, and he alwaies doubteth whether he be heard, eſpecially when he is in miſery, and then is he angry with God, and thinketh that he is unjuſtly puniſhed, ſeeing he was a honeſt Citizen, and profitable for the Common-wealth. Such darkneſſe in the minde,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61072:113"/> is great ſinne, ſuch as reaſon, not being illuminated by God, is is not able to judge of.</p>
                     <p>Therefore inward obedience, true knowledge of God, the feare of God, ſorrowes in repentance, truſt to obtaine mercie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for the Sonne of God, invocation, hope, love, joy in God, and other vertues muſt be begun alſo in the regenerate, and they muſt be referred to a proper end, to wit, that God may be obeyed. Theſe kindes of true worſhip cannot be given unto God, without the light of the Goſpel, and without faith: which our adverſaries, who will ſeeme to be jolly preachers of good workes, do neither underſtand, nor require: ſeeing they omit the doctrine of faith, which is a confidence to obtaine mercy, reſting in the Sonne of God, which is an eſpeciall worke, and the chiefe worſhip of God. Of workes not commanded of God, we ſhall ſpeake hereafter, and we muſt hold faſt that rule, <hi>Matth. 15. In vaine doe they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me with the commandements of men.</hi> And in the Church in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out oftentimes, that ceremonies deviſed by men are more carefully kept, then the commandements of God, yea the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Phariſaicall and unjuſt traditions is preferred before the the commandement of God: as in many ages, for the unjuſt and wicked commandement of ſingle life, the commandement of God concerning true chaſtitie, was horribly violated.

                     <head>How our new obedience doth pleaſe God.</head>
                     <p>THE Phariſee in <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. 18. doth admire and pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being bewitched with this perſwaſion, that he doth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the law, and for this diſcipline, ſuch as it is, doth pleaſe God. Many ſuch there be among men, who thinke themſelves ſecure, if they performe never ſo little though it be but a ſhadow of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. But the heavenly voice doth often times accuſe the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie of theſe men: and therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>Luk. 13. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye repent, ye ſhall all in like ſort periſh,</hi> and 1 <hi>Joh. 1. If we ſay we have no ſinne we are lyers.</hi> Therefore their imagination is vaine, which thinke that obedience doth pleaſe God for it own worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that it is a merit of Condignitie, as they ſpeake, and ſuch a righteouſneſſe before God, as is a merit of eternall life. And yet afterward they do adde, that we muſt alwaies doubt whether our obedience doe pleaſe God, becauſe it is evident, that in every one there is much pollution, many ſins of ignorance, and omiſſion, and many not ſmall blemiſhes. Here it is neceſſary that mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſhould be inſtructed aright in either of theſe points, both concerning our infirmitie, and alſo concerning the comfort. It is neceſſarie that the regenerate ſhould have the righteouſneſſe of a good conſcience, and obedience begun in this life, as hath been ſaid: yet nevertheleſſe, in this life there is ſtill remaining in our nature, in our ſoule, and in our heart, very much pollution, which they doe the more ſee, and be waile, which have received more light then others, as the Prophets and Apoſtles, according to that complaint of <hi>Paul, Rom. 7. I ſee another law in my members, which ſtriveth againſt the law of my minde, and maketh me captive to the law of ſinne.</hi> There is as yet in every one a great miſt, manifold ignorance, and many ſorrowfull doubts, errors in counſels, raiſed by diſtruſt, by falſe opinions, and a vaine hope, many vicious flames of luſts, much neglect of dutie, murmurings and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations againſt God in his puniſhments: to conclude it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſſe and madneſſe, not to be willing to confeſſe that the feare and love of God is much more cold in us, then it ought to be. Theſe confeſſions are repeated in the Sermons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, <hi>Pſal 143. Enter not into iudgement with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be iuſtified.</hi> And 1 <hi>Joh. 1. If we ſay, that we have no ſinne, we deceive our ſelves, and the trueth is not in us.</hi> This confeſſion is neceſſary, and mans
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61072:114"/> arrogancie to be reprooved. Alſo the error of our adverſaries, who feigne, that men in this mortall life may ſatinfie the law of God, and of thoſe, who ſay, that the evill of concupiſcence, which is bred with us, is not ſin, not an evill repugnant to the law or will of God, is to be reprehended. Theſe errours doth <hi>Paul</hi> manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confute, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and 8.</p>
                     <p>Then muſt comfort alſo be joyned thereunto.

Secondly, let us confeſſe with true griefe, that there remaine as yet in the regenerate man many ſinnes, and much pollution, worthy of the wrath of God.

For man is made acceptable to God, and counted juſt before him, for the onely Son of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, through faith: and when we appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement ſeat of God, we muſt not truſt to the merit of any of thoſe vertues, which we have, but onely to the merit of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe merit is ours by faith.

For whatſoever the law teacheth, hitherto it tendeth, and this one thing it requireth, that at the length we may be reformed to the perfect image of God, being good in all things, and ready and willing to doe men good, the which we cannot doe, except we be adorned with all kindes of vertues. For who can purpoſe and doe all things (as the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a Chriſtian doth require, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.) to the true edifying of the Church, and the ſound profit of all men, that is, according to the law of God, and to the glory of God, except that he both thinke, ſpeake, and doe every thing in order, and well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be very familliarly acquainted with the whole company of vertues.</p>

                     <p>NOw it cannot be doubted of, what be the duties of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man, and to what actions he ought chiefly to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, namely to all thoſe, whereby every one, for his part, may profit his neighbours, and that firſt, in things pertaining to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, that they alſo may begin to know, worſhip, and feare God, and then in things pertaining to this life, that they may want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is neceſſarie to the ſuſtenance of the body. For as the whole law of God, which is a moſt abſolute commandement of all righteouſneſſe, is briefly contained in this one word, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi> ſo in the performance of this love, it is neceſſarie that all righteouſneſſe ſhould be compriſed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited. Whereupon it followeth, that nothing at all is to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the duties of a Chriſtian man, which is not of force and effect to profit our neighbour, and every worke is ſo much the more belonging to the duty of Chriſtian man, by how much his neighbour may the more be profited thereby. Therefore next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eccleſiaſticall functions, among the chiefe duties of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man, we place the government of the Common weale, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Magiſtrates (for theſe be referred to the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit) that care which is taken for our wife, children, family, and the honour which is due to parents, (becauſe that without theſe the life of man cannot conſiſt) and laſtly, the profeſſion of good arts and of all honeſt diſcipline, becauſe that except theſe be had in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, we ſhall be deſtitute of the greateſt good things, which are proper to mankinde. Yet in theſe, and all other duties pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mans like, no man muſt raſhly take any thing to himſelfe, but with a right conſcience conſider, whereunto God doth call him. To conclude, let every man account that his dutie, and that ſo much the more excellent a dutie, the more that he ſhall profit other men thereby.</p>

                  <p>The Church is divided by ſome into divers parts or divers ſorts: not that it is rent and divided from it ſelfe, but rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, in reſpect of the diverſitie of the members that be in it. One part thereof they make to be the Church militant, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church triumphant. The militant warreth ſtill on the earth and fighteth againſt the fleſh, the world, and the prince of the world, the devill, and againſt ſinne and death. The other being already ſet at libertie, is now in heaven, and triumpheth over all thoſe being overcome, and continually rejoyceth before the Lord. Yet theſe two Churches have notwithſtanding a communion and fellowſhip betweene themſelves. The Church militant upon the earth hath evermore had in it many particular Churches, which muſt all notwithſtanding be referred to the unitie of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. This militant Church was otherwiſe ordered and governed before the law, among the Patriarkes, otherwiſe under <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the Law, and otherwiſe of Chriſt, by the Goſpel. There are but two ſorts of people for the moſt part mentioned, to wit, the Iſraelites, and the Gentiles, or they which of the Iewes and Gentiles were gathered to make a Church. There be alſo two Teſtaments, the Old and the New. Yet both theſe ſorts of people have had, and ſtill have one fellowſhip, one ſalvation in one and the ſame Meſſiah, in whom, as members of one body, they are all joyned together under one head, and by one faith are all partakers of one and the ſame ſpirituall meate and drinke. Yet here we doe acknowledge a diverſitie of times and a diverſitie in the pledges and ſignes of Chriſt promiſed, and exhibited, and that now the ceremonies being aboliſhed, the light ſhineth unto us more cleerely, our gifts and graces are more aboundant, and our libertie is more full and ample.</p>
                  <p>This holy Church of God is called <hi>the houſe of the living God, builded of living and ſpirituall ſtones, founded upon a rocke, that cannot be removed, upon a foundation, beſides which none can be laid:</hi>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:61072:121"/> Whereupon it is called <hi>the pillar and foundation of the truth,</hi> that<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.</note> doth not erre, ſo long as it relyeth upon the rock Chriſt, and upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles. And no marvell, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the firſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. upon this confeſſion.</note> if it doe erre, ſo often as it forſaketh him, who is the alone truth. This Church is alſo called a <hi>virgin, and the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and his onely beloved.</hi> For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I have ioyned you unto one husband, that I might preſent you a chaſte virgin unto Chriſt. The Church is called a flocke of ſheepe under one ſhepheard,</hi> even Chriſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. alſo <hi>the body of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe the faithfull are the lively members of Chriſt, having him for their head.</p>
                  <p>It is the head which hath the preheminence in the body, and from whence the whole body receiveth life, by whoſe ſpirit it is governed in all things, of whom alſo it receiveth increaſe, that it may grow up. Alſo there is but one head of the body, which hath agreement with the body, and therefore the Church cannot have any other head beſide Chriſt. For as the Church is a ſpirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo muſt it needs have a ſpiritua I head like unto it ſelfe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be governed by any other ſpirit, then by the ſpirit of Chriſt. Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>And he is the head of his body the</hi>

                     </gap>itant here on earth, and the very Vicar of Chriſt, who hath (as they ſay) all fulneſſe of power and ſoveraigne authoritie in the Church. For we hold and teach, that Chriſt our Lord is, and remaineth ſtill, the onely uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Paſtour, and higheſt Biſhop, before God his Father, and that in the Church he performeth all the duties of a Paſtour or Biſhop, even to the worlds end: and therefore ſtandeth not in need of any other to ſupply his roome, for he is ſaid to have a ſubſtitute, which is abſent. But Chriſt is preſent with his Church, and is the head that giveth life thereunto. He did ſtraightly forbid his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and their ſucceſſours all ſuperioritie or dominion in the Church. They therefore that by gaine-ſaying ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61072:121"/> ſo manifeſt a truth, and bring another kinde of government into the Church, who ſeeth not that they are to be counted in the number of them, of whom the Apoſtles of Chriſt propheſied? as <hi>Peter</hi> 2 Epiſt. 2. and <hi>Paul Act. 20. 2 Cor. 11. 2 Theſſ.</hi> 2. and in many other places.</p>
                  <p>Now by taking away the Romiſh head, we doe not bring any confuſion or diſorder into the Church: for we teach that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church which the Apoſtles ſet downe, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keep the Church in due order, which from the beginning, while as yet it wanted ſuch a Romiſh head, as is now pretended to keepe it in order, was not diſordered or full of confuſion. That Romiſh head doth maintaine indeed that tyranny and corruption in the Church, which was brought into the Church: But in the meane time he hindreth, reſiſteth, and with all the might hee can make, cutteth off the right and lawfull reformation of the Church.</p>
                  <p>They object againſt us, that there have beene great ſtrifes and diſſentions in our Churches, ſince they did ſever themſelves from the Church of Rome, and that therefore they cannot be true Churches. As though there were never in the Church of Rome any ſects, any contentions and quarrels, and that in matters of religion, maintained, not ſo much in the Schooles, as in the holy chaires, even in the audience of the people. We know that the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>God is not the authour of diſſention, but of peace.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> And <hi>Seeing there is amongſt you emulation and contention, are you not carnall?</hi> Yet may we not deny, but that God was in that Church, planted by the Apoſtle, and that that Apoſtolike Church was a true church, howſoever there were ſtrifes and diſſentions in it. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reprehended <hi>Peter</hi> an Apoſtle, and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.

And there have at all times beene great contentions in the Church, and and the moſt excellent Doctors of the Church have about no ſmall matters differed in opinions, yet ſo, as in the meane time the Church ceaſed not to be the church for all theſe contentions. For thus it pleaſeth God to uſe the diſſentions that ariſe in the church, to the glory of his name, the ſetting forth of the truth, and to the end <hi>that ſuch as are not approved might be manifeſt.</hi> Now as we acknowledge no other head of the Church then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo we doe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61072:122"/> not acknowledg every church to be the true church which vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſelfe ſo to be: but we teach that to be the true Church indeed, in which the markes and tokens of the true church are to be found.

                  <p>But yet we doe not ſo ſtrictly ſhut up the church within thoſe markes before mentioned, as thereby to exclude all thoſe out of it, which either doe not communicate in the Sacraments (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they want them, or elſe not willingly, nor upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but being conſtrained by neceſſitie, doe againſt their wils abſtain from them) or in whom faith doth ſometimes faile, though not quite decay, nor altogether die: or in whom ſome ſlips and errours of infirmitie may be found: for we know that God had ſome friends in the world, that were not of the common wealth of Iſrael. We know what befell the people of God in the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Babylon, where they wanted their ſacrifices ſeventy yeers. We know very well what hapned to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who denied his Maſter, and what is wont daily to fall out among the faithfull and choſen of God, which goe aſtray and are full of infirmities. We know moreover what manner of Churches the Churches at <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> were in the Apoſtles time: in which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> condemneth divers great and heinous crimes, yet he calleth them <hi>the holy Churches of Chriſt.</hi> Yea and it falleth out ſometimes, that God in his juſt judgement ſuffereth the truth of his word, and the Catholike Faith, and his owne true worſhip to be ſo obſcured and defaced, that the church ſeemeth almoſt quite raſed out, and not ſo much as a face of a church to remaine, as we ſee fell out in the dayes of <hi>Eliah,</hi> and at other times.

                  <p>Againe, not all, that are reckoned in the number of the church, are Saints, and the lively and true members of the church: for there be many hypocrites, which outwardly doe heare the word of God, and publikely receive the Sacraments, and beare a ſhew to pray unto God alone through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to confeſſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be their onely righteouſneſſe: and doe ſeeme outwardly to worſhip
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61072:123"/> God, and to exerciſe the duties of charitie to the brethren, and for a while through patience to indure in troubles and calamities: And yet they are altogether deſtitute of the inward illumination of the ſpirit of God, of faith, and ſinceritie of heart, and of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance or continuance to the end. And theſe men are for the moſt part at the length laid open what they be. For the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>They went out from among us, but they were not of us:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Iohn 2.</note> 
                     <hi>for if they had beene of us, they would have tarried with us.</hi> Yet theſe men, whileſt they doe pretend religion, they are accounted to be in the church, howſoever indeed they be not of the church. Even as traitours in a commonwealth before they be detected are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the number of good Citizens: and as the cockle and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell and chaffe are found amongſt the wheate: and as wennes and ſwellings are in a perfect body, when they are rather diſeaſes and deformities, then true members of the body. And therefore the<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> church is very well compared to a draw net, which draweth up fiſhes of all ſorts: and to a field, wherein is found both darnell and good corne. We are to have a ſpeciall regard, that we judge not raſhly before the time, nor goe about to exclude, caſt off and cut away them, whom the Lord would not have excluded, nor cut off, or whom without ſome damage to the church, we cannot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from it. Againe we muſt be very vigilant, leſt that the godly falling faſt aſleepe, the wicked grow ſtronger, and do ſome miſchiefe to the church.</p>
                  <p>Further more we teach, that it is carefully to be marked, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eſpecially the truth and unitie of the church conſiſteth, leſt that we either raſhly breed or nouriſh ſchiſmes in the church, It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in outward rites and ceremonies, but rather in the truth and unitie of the Catholike faith. This Catholike faith is not taught us by the ordinances or laws of men, but by the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a compendious and ſhort ſumme whereof is the Apoſtles Creed. And therefore we reade in the ancient Writers, that there was manifold diverſities of ceremonies, but that was alwaies free, neither did any man thinke that the unitie of the church was thereby broken or diſſolved. We ſay then that the true unity of the Church doth conſiſt in ſeverall points of doctrine, in the true and uniforme preaching of the Goſpel, and in ſuch rites, as the Lord himſelfe hath expreſly ſet downe: and here we urge that ſaying of the Apoſtle very earneſtly, <hi>As many of us therefore</hi>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61072:123"/> the Lord ſhall reveale the ſame unto him. And yet in that whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we have attained, let us follow one direction, and all of us be like affected one towards another.</hi>

Every Chriſtian is alſo bound with diligent care to ſeeke after this and ſuch a true part of the holy church, and after he hath found it, to joyne and maintaine holy communion and fellowſhip therewith, as the other part of that point of the Church in our Chriſtian Creed doth declare, where we doe profeſſe, that <hi>we beleeve the communion of Saints:</hi> and ought altogether, with this fellowſhip, or ſpirituall company of Gods people, to maintaine the true unitie and concord of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſpirit, to love and beare good will to all the members, to yeeld obedience thereunto, and endevour, by all meanes poſſible, to procure the profit and furtherance thereof, and in truth to hold agreement therewith, and by no meanes through ſtubbornneſſe to move ſchiſmes, ſeditions and ſects, againſt the truth.

                  <p>Together with theſe things the Miniſters of our Churches teach, that this is to be thought of their fellowſhip, which is in like manner to be thought of any other Chriſtian fellowſhip, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be great, or ſmall: to wit, that it ſelfe alone is not that holy Catholike Chriſtian Church, but onely one part thereof, as the Apoſtle writeth of the church at Corinth, <hi>Ye are the body of Chriſt,</hi>

                     <hi>and members of him, every one for his part.</hi> They teach alſo that there muſt be a platforme and certaine order of government in the holy Church. Now without a platforme of order and outward government, it cannot be in good caſe or goe well with it, no more then it can with any other even the leaſt ſocietie. But this platforme of order conſiſteth chiefly in this, that they be both or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily called, and lawfully ordained, who execute due functions in the ſame, beginning at the leaſt, and proceeding to thoſe that are of a mean ſort, and ſo forth even to the chiefeſt. The next point is, that every one doe well diſcharge that place, and as it were his ward, to which he is called, and uſe watchfulneſſe, and ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be found wanting in himſelfe, nor at his own pleaſure do cloſely convey himſelfe out of the ſame, or goe beyond the bounds thereof, and meddle with other mens charges, and moreover, that all among themſelves ſubmit themſelves one to another, and all performe obedience from the leaſt to the greateſt, every man in his owne place, whereunto he is called: and doe it with the affection of love, and of his owne accord, not of conſtraint, even for Chriſts ſake, and for the care they have of eternall ſalvation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.

This laudable order of governing the Church together with lawfull
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61072:125"/> diſcipline, that is, with the ſeveritie of puniſhments appointed by God, which it hath annexed unto it, ought diligently to be exerciſed: to wit, ſo, that the wicked, and ſuch as abide in mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſinnes without repentance, having their hearts hardened, and ſuch ſinners, as give not obedience to God, and to his word, and in the Church are authours of great offences, and doe not repent, or become better, after due, faithfull, and ſufficient warning, that ſuch, I ſay, may be publiquely puniſhed, and be removed from the holy fellowſhip, by Eccleſiaſticall puniſhment, which <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. upon this confeſſion.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is called abandoning, excommunication, or curſing, yet not by the helpe of the civill power, but by vertue of the word and the commandement of Chriſt.

                  <p>We beleeve, that very carefully and wiſely the true Church<note place="margin">Artic. 27.</note> (the name whereof too many do abuſe) is to be diſcerned. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we affirme out of the word of God, that the Church is a company of the faithfull, which agree together in following the word of God, and in imbracing pure Religion, wherein alſo they doe daily profit, growing and confirming themſelves mutually in the feare of God, as they which have need daily to goe forward and to profit, and who, although they profit never ſo much, muſt notwithſtanding of neceſſitie daily flie to the remiſſion of ſinnes.

                  <p>Therefore, ſeeing we beleeve this to be ſo, we withall boldly<note place="margin">Artic. 28.</note> affirme, that where the word of God is not received, and where there is no profeſſion of that obedience which is due thereunto, nor any uſe of Sacraments, there (if we will ſpeake properly) we cannot judge any Church to be.

                  <p>VVE beleeve, that there is one Church of God, and that the ſame is not ſhut up (as in times paſt among the Iews) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Artic. 4.</note> ſome one corner or kingdome, but that it is Catholike, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, and diſperſed throughout the whole world. So that there is now no nation, which may truely complaine, that they be ſhut forth, and may not be one of the Church and people of God: and that this Church is the Kingdome, the Body, and the Spouſe of Chriſt: that Chriſt alone is the Prince of this Kingdome: that Chriſt alone is the Head of this Body: and that Chriſt alone is the Bridegroome of this Spouſe.</p>

                  <p>VVE beleeve and confeſſe, that there is one Catholike or V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall<note place="margin">Artic. 27.</note> Church, which is the true Congregation or companie of all faithfull Chriſtians, which doe looke for their whole ſalvation from Chriſt alone, in as much as they be waſhed in his blood, and ſanctified and ſealed by his ſpirit. Furthermore, as this Church hath been from the beginning of the world, ſo it ſhall continue unto the end thereof. The which appeareth by this, that Chriſt is our eternall King, who can never be without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. This Church God doth defend againſt all the fury and force of the world, although for a ſmall time it may ſeeme to be very little, and as it were utterly extinguiſhed, to the ſight of man: even as in the perilous time of <hi>Achab,</hi> God is ſaid: to <hi>have reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to himſelfe ſeven thouſand men, which bowed not their knees to Baal.</hi> To conclude, this holy Church is not ſituated or limited in any ſet or certaine place, nor yet bound and tied to any certaine and peculiar perſons, but ſpread over the face of the whole earth, though in minde and will, by one and the ſame ſpirit, through the power of faith, it be wholly joyned and united together.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve, that ſeeing this holy Companie and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Artic. 28.</note> conſiſteth of thoſe that are to be ſaved, and out of it there is no ſalvation, therefore no man, of how great dignitie and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence ſoever, ought to ſeparate and ſunder himſelfe from it, that being contented with his own ſolitary eſtate, he ſhould live apart by himſelfe. But on the contrary ſide, that all and every one are
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61072:127"/> bound to aſſociate themſelves to this companie, carefully to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the unitie of the Church, to ſubmit himſelfe both to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and diſcipline of the ſame, finally to put his necke willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the yoake of Chriſt, as common members of the ſame body, to ſeeke the edification of their brethren, according to the meaſure of gifts, which God hath beſtowed upon every one. Moreover, to the end that theſe things may the better be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it is the part and dutie of every faithfull man to ſeparate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe according to Gods word, from all thoſe which are without the Church, and to couple himſelfe unto this company of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, whereſoever God hath placed it, yea though contrary Edicts of Princes and Magiſtrates doe forbid them, upon paine of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death, preſently to enſue upon all thoſe, which doe the ſame. Whoſoever therefore doe either depart from the true Church, or refuſe to joyn themſelves unto it, do openly reſiſt the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve, that with great diligence and wiſdome it ought to be ſearched and examined by the word of God, what the true<note place="margin">Artic. 29.</note> Church is, ſeeing that all the Sects, that at this day have ſprung up in the world, doe uſurpe and falſely pretend the name and title of the Church. Yet here we doe not ſpeake of the company of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, which together with the good are mingled in the Church, though properly they doe not pertaine to the Church, wherein they are onely preſent with their bodies; but onely of the manner, how to diſtinguiſh the Body and Congregation of the true Church from all other Sects, which doe falſely boaſt that they be the members of the Church. Wherefore the true Church may be diſcerned from the falſe by theſe notes. Firſt, if the pure preaching of the Goſpell doe flouriſh in it, if it have the lawfull adminiſtration of the Sacraments, according to Chriſt his inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: if it doe uſe the right Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, for the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vice: Finally, to knit up all in one word, if it doe ſquare all things to the rule of Gods word, refuſing whatſoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, acknowledging Chriſt to be the onely head of the ſame. By theſe notes, I ſay, it is certaine that the true Church may be diſcerned. From the which it is not lawfull for any man to be ſevered. Now who be the true members of this true Church, it may be gathered by theſe marks and tokens which be common to all Chriſtians: ſuch is faith, by the vertue whereof, having once apprehended Chriſt the onely Saviour, they doe flie ſinne, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61072:128"/> follow righteouſneſſe, loving the true God, and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, without turning either to the right hand, or to the left and doe crucifie their fleſh with the effects thereof, not as if no infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie at all remained ſtill within them, but becauſe they doe fight all their life long againſt the fleſh by the power of the ſpirit, having often recourſe unto the blood, death, paſſion, and obedience of our Lord Chriſt, as unto a moſt ſafe refuge, in whom alone they are aſſured to finde redemption for their ſins, through faith in him. But on the other ſide, the falſe Church doth alwaies attribute more unto her ſelfe, to her owne decrees and traditions, then to the word of God, and will not ſuffer her ſelfe to be ſubject to the yoake of Chriſt, neither doth adminiſter the Sacraments, ſo as Chriſt hath preſcribed, but at her own will and pleaſure, doth one while adde unto them, another while detract from them. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, ſhe doth alwaies leane more to men, then to Chriſt: and whoſoever doe goe about to lead a holy life, according to the preſcript rule of Gods Word, whoſoever doth rebuke and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove her faults, as her covetouſneſſe, and idolatry, thoſe ſhe doth perſecute with a deadly hatred. By theſe marks therefore it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to diſcerne and diſtinguiſh both theſe Churches the one from the other.</p>

Now the Church properly ſo called, hath her notes and marks, to wit, the pure and ſound Doctrine of the Goſpel and the right uſe of the Sacraments. And for the true unitie of the Church, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to agree upon the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments.

                  <p>GOd will have us to underſtand, that mankinde is not borne by chance, but that it is created of God, and created, not to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<note place="margin">Artic. 11.</note> deſtruction, but that out of mankinde he might gather unto himſelfe a Church, to the which in all eternitie he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his wiſdome, goodneſſe, and joy: and he will have his Sonne to be ſeene, for whom and through whom, by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable wiſdome, and infinite mercie, he hath repaired this miſerable nature of men. Therefore amongſt men he would at all times have a companie, whereunto he delivered the doctrine, concerning his Sonne, and wherein the Sonne himſelfe did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and preſerve a miniſterie, to keepe and ſpread abroad that doctrine, by the which he hath been, is, and will be effectuall, and hath converted many to himſelfe, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth manifeſtly teach: <hi>The Goſpell is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that beleeveth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is to be marvelled at, and to be lamented, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of mankinde, being carried away with a horrible rage, ſhould contemne this voice, and teſtimonie of God, and the Son of God: and that in this company, which hath the name of the Church, there have been alwaies many diviſions, and that the true Church hath been overcome by forreine and domeſticall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. When men doe looke upon theſe diſſentions, and doe ſee that they which imbrace other doctrines repugnant to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, doe get the upper hand in kingdomes, multitude, and glory, they doubt whether there be any Church of God, which it is,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61072:129"/> what manner of Church it is, and where it ſhould be. And for prophane men it is a hard matter to judge hereof: but the true Church doth certainly know out of the divine Teſtament, whence theſe ſo great furies of men doe ariſe, and yet that amongſt them the Church of God is preſerved; and doth diſcerne it from other nations, and knoweth which is it, what manner of one it is, and where to be found. Therefore that all godly men might be the better confirmed againſt theſe doubts, This Article is ſet before them in the Creed: <hi>I beleeve the holy Catholike Church.</hi> By this profeſſion we affirme, that all mankinde is not rejected of God, but that there is, and ſhall remaine, a certaine true Church, that the promiſes of God are ſure, and that the Sonne of God doth as yet reigne, receive, and ſave thoſe that call upon him. And being raiſed up by this comfort, we doe give God thanks, and invocate him, we do deſire, receive, and look for eternall good things at his hand.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of this admonition and comfort, the Article in the Creed is rehearſed, ſeeing that the ſelfe ſame doctrine, touching the preſerving of the Church, is very often repeated in ſundry Sermons in the booke of God: as <hi>Iſa. 59. This is my covenant with them, ſaith the Lord: my Spirit, which is upon thee, and my words, which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth even for ever.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am with you for ever, even to the end of the world.</hi> Alſo this is a ſweet comfort, that the heires of eterna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But turne thou thy eyes hither: Know for a certaintie, that in this companie of thoſe which are called, ſome be choſen, and jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Lord ſaid to me, thou art my Sonne, this day have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee. Be wiſe now therefore ye Kings.</hi> We ſay therefore, that the viſible Church in this life is a companie of thoſe, which doe embrace the Goſpell of Chriſt, and uſe the Sacraments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, wherein God by the miniſtery of the Goſpell is effectuall, and doth renue many to life eternall. And yet in this company there be many, which are not holy, but do agree together, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true doctrine, as in the time of <hi>Mary,</hi> theſe were the Church, to wit, <hi>Zacharie, Simeon, Joſeph, Elizabeth, Mary, Anne,</hi> the teachers, and many other, who agreed with them in the pure doctrine, and did not heare the Sadduces and the Phariſees, but <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary, Simeon, Anne, Mary,</hi> and ſuch like, &amp;c. For when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie is very ſmall, yet God doth reſerve ſome remnants, whoſe voice and confeſſion is heard, and he doth oftentimes renue the miniſtery, according to that ſaying: <hi>Except the Lord had left a ſeed unto us, we had been like to Sodome, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore this deſcription, taken out of the manifeſt teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scriptures, doth declare, which is the Church, what it is, and where it is. We may not doubt, that the Church is tied to the Goſpell, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man teach another Goſpell, let him be accurſed.</hi> And, <hi>Joh. 10. My ſheepe heare my voice.</hi> And, <hi>Joh. 14. If any man loveth me, he heareth my word, and my Father ſhall love him, and we will come to him, and will dwell with him.</hi> And, <hi>Joh. 17. Sanctifie them with thy word, thy word is truth.</hi> Therefore the Sadduces, the Phariſees, and ſuch like Biſhops, and others, who ſet forth an other doctrine, differing from the Goſpell, and doe obſtinately eſtabliſh idolatry, are no members of the Church of God, although they hold a title and dominions. But it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that our adverſaries teach and defend another kinde of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine differing from the Goſpell, ſeeing they teach that the Law of God may be fulfilled by our obedience in this life, and that this obedience doth deſerve remiſſion of ſinnes: Alſo, that by this obedience men are made righteous before God. Alſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill concupiſcence is not ſin, nor an evill reſiſting of the law of God. Alſo, that they which are converted, muſt doubt, whether they be in ſtate of grace, and that this doubting is not ſinne. Alſo, that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61072:130"/> dead men are to be prayed unto. Alſo, that difference of meats, monaſticall vowes, and other ceremonies, choſen without any commandement of God, are the ſervice of God. Alſo, that the ſacrifice in the maſſe doth deſerve the remiſſion of ſinnes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, both for him that maketh it, and alſo for others that are alive or dead. Alſo, other manifold and horrible prophanations of the Sacraments. Alſo, that Biſhops may appoint ſervices of God, and that the violating of thoſe ſervices, which are appointed by them, is mortall ſinne. Alſo, that they may enjoyne the law of ſingle life, to any degree of men. Alſo, that the rehearſall of all and every offence is neceſſarie to the obtaining of remiſſion of ſinnes. Alſo, that Canonicall ſatisfactions doe recompence the puniſhments of Purgatorie. Alſo, that thoſe Synods wherein the Biſhops alone doe give their judgement, cannot erre. Alſo, they which doe conſecrate oyles, and other things, without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, and doe attribute thereunto a divine power againſt ſins, and Devils, and diſeaſes: Alſo, they which allow of prayers made to certaine Images, as though there were more helpe to be had: Alſo, they which doe kill honeſt men, onely for that they diſlike theſe errours, and doe profeſſe the truth: Theſe things ſeeing they be altogether heatheniſh and idolatrous, it is manifeſt, that the maintainers thereof, are not members of the Church, but doe rule and have ſoveraigntie, as the Phariſees and Saduces did. Nevertheleſſe there have beene, are, and ſhall be in the Church of God, ſuch men as doe keepe the foundation, although ſome had, have, and ſhall have more light, and others leſſe. And ſomtimes alſo even the very Saints doe build ſtubble upon the foundation, eſpecially ſeeing that the miſerie of theſe times doth not ſuffer thoſe, which have the beginnings of faith, to be inſtructed, and to conferre with the better learned. Yet theſe are in the number of thoſe, whom the Lord commandeth to be ſpared, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9. who ſigh and are ſorry, becauſe that errours are eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore chiefly by the voyce of the Doctrine we may and ought to judge, which, and where the true Church is, which by the voyce of the true doctrine, and then by the lawfull uſe of the Sacraments, is diſtinguiſhed from other nations. And what is the voice of the true doctrine, the writings of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the Creeds, doe declare. In theſe the doctrine is not doubtfull, touching the foundation, to wit, touching the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61072:130"/> of faith, the eſſence and will of God, the Sonne the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Law, the Promiſes, the uſe of the Sacraments, and the miniſtery. And it is manifeſt, that it is not permitted to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not to Angels, nor to men, to change that doctrine, which is delivered of God.</p>
                  <p>Now what the Church is, the Sonne of God ſheweth, ſaying, <hi>My kingdome is not of this world.</hi> Alſo, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo doe I ſend you.</hi> By the voice of the Miniſters of the Goſpell an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Church is gathered to God, and by this voice God is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, and turneth many to himſelfe. This exceeding great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of God, we ought to acknowledge, and thankfully to extoll. And although the Church be a companie, that may be ſeene and heard, yet it is to be diſtinguiſhed from Politicall Empires, or thoſe that beare the ſword. Biſhops have not authoritie by the Law of God to puniſh the diſobedient, neither doe they poſſeſſe the kingdomes of the world, and yet in the Church there is an order, according to that ſaying, <hi>He aſcended, he giveth gifts to Men, Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Teachers.</hi> The Sonne of God is the high Prieſt, anoynted of the eternall Father, who, that the Church might not utterly periſh, hath given unto it Miniſters of the Goſpell, partly called immediatly by himſelfe, as the Prophets and Apoſtles, partly choſen by the calling of men. For he doth both allow of the choiſe of the Church, and of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſſe he is effectuall, even when the Goſpell doth ſound, by ſuch as are choſen by voices, or in the name of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we doe retaine in our Churches alſo the publique rite of Ordination, whereby the miniſterie of the Goſpell is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to thoſe that are truely choſen, whoſe manners and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we doe firſt throughly examine. And touching the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of the miniſtery, we doe faithfully teach our Churches. No greater thing can be ſpoken then that which the Sonne of God ſaith: <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo doe I ſend you.</hi> He alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth what commandements he giveth, <hi>Preach ye the Goſpell,</hi> and he affirmeth, that he will be effectuall by their voice, as the Father ſheweth himſelfe to be effectuall by the Son. Alſo, we ſet before men the commandements of God. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me: and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Obey them that have the overſight of you.</hi> And yet theſe ſayings doe not erect a kingdome without the Goſpel: but they command an obedience
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61072:131"/> which is due to the voice of the Goſpel. And theſe things pertaine to the miniſtery: To teach the Goſpell, to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to give Abſolution to them that aske it, and doe not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in manifeſt offences: to ordaine Miniſters of the Goſpell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly called and examined, to exerciſe the judgements of the Church after a lawfull manner, upon thoſe <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. Obſervat. upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion.</note> which are guiltie of manifeſt crimes in manners or in doctrine, and to pronounce the ſentence of excommunication againſt them that are ſtubborne, and againe to abſolve and pardon them that do repent. That theſe things may be done orderly, there be alſo Conſiſtories appointed in our Churches.</p>
                  <p>We ſaid in the deſcription of the Church, that there be many in this viſible Church, which be not holy, who notwithſtanding in outward profeſſion doe imbrace the true Doctrine. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Donatiſts, who feigned that their miniſterie is not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, which are not holy. Alſo we condemne that Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall filth, which feigned that to be the viſible Church, wherein all are holy. And we confeſſe that we are ſo to thinke of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church in this life, as our Lord ſaith. <hi>Matth. 12. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, is like unto a draw net, caſt into the ſea, wherein fiſhes are gathered both good and bad:</hi> but yet they which become ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the true doctrine, ceaſe to be members of this viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, according to this ſaying: <hi>If any man teach another Goſpell, let him be accurſed.</hi>

For the miniſterie of remitting or retaining ſins, which otherwiſe is called <hi>the Key of the kingdome of heaven,</hi> is not given to the free power of the perſon of men, but it is ſo neerely annexed to the word of the Goſpell, that ſo many as doe preach the Goſpell, may truly be ſaid to remit, and to retaine ſins, to wit, to remit their ſins, who by faith do receive the Goſpell; to retaine theirs, that doe contemne the Goſpell. <hi>Mar. 16. Preach the Goſpell to every creature. He that ſhall beleeve, and be baptized, ſhall be ſaved: but he that will not beleeve, ſhall be damned.</hi> Hilarie, <hi>De Trinit. lib.</hi> 6. ſaith. <hi>The Father revealed it to</hi> Peter, <hi>that he ſhould ſay, thou art the Sonne of God, Therefore upon this rocke of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is the Church builded: this faith is the foundation of the Church: whatſoever this faith ſhall looſe or binde in earth, ſhall be looſed or bound in heaven.</hi> Chryſoſtome ſaith: <hi>They which beare the keyes be the Prieſts, to whom the word of teaching, and interpreting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is committed. Now the key is the word of the knowledge of the Scriptures, by which key the truth is opened to men.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>De Doctr. Chriſt. Lib. 1. Cap.</hi> 18. ſaith: <hi>Theſe keyes did he give to the Church, that whatſoever it looſeth in earth, ſhould be looſed in heaven: to wit, that whoſoever would not beleeve, that his ſinnes are forgiven him in the Church, they ſhould not be forgiven to him: but whoſoever ſhould beleeve, and being corrected doth turne from his ſins, being placed in the lap of the Church, ſhould, by the ſame faith and correction be healed.</hi> Ambroſe ſaith, <hi>Sinnes are remitted by the word, whereof the Levite is the Interpreter or Expounder.</hi> Bernard. <hi>in Epiſt. ad Eug.</hi> ſaith: <hi>The true ſucceſſour of</hi> Paul <hi>will ſay with</hi> Paul, <hi>Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we are helpers of your ioy. The heires of</hi> Peter <hi>will heare</hi> Peter <hi>ſaying: Not as though ye were Lords over Gods heritage, but that ye may be enſamples to the flocke.</hi> Thomas, <hi>in Summa ſua, parte, 3. in addit. q. 6. art.</hi> 6. ſaith: <hi>Becauſe the Church is founded upon Faith, and the Sacraments, therefore it doth not pertaine to the Miniſters of the Church to make new Articles of Faith, or to ſet apart thoſe which are made, neither to appoint new Sacraments, or to take away thoſe, which are appointed: but this is proper to that excellencie of power, which is due to Chriſt alone, who is the foundation of the Church. And therefore, as the Pope cannot diſpenſe, that any one may be ſaved without Baptiſme, ſo cannot he not diſpenſe with any to be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confeſſion, becauſe that he bindeth by force of a Sacrament.</hi> And
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61072:132"/> although <hi>Thomas</hi> have his opinions, touching confeſſion, yet this which he ſaith, <hi>It doth not pertaine to the Miniſters of the Church</hi> (among whom he reckoneth the Pope) <hi>to make new Articles of Faith, and to appoint new Sacraments,</hi> is indeed an Apoſtolike and Catholike judgement. For no other miniſterie doth pertaine to the Miniſters of the Church, which have their calling from Chriſt, then that which we mentioned before, and which the Apoſtles of Chriſt, themſelves did execute, touching the remitting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſins. Therefore if any thing more then this miniſterie be attributed to the Biſhop of Rome, this is either given unto him by mans ordinances, or elſe it is feigned by the Monks and other flatterers, againſt the authoritie of the word of God.</p>

But we thinke, that men are to judge, by the authoritie, both of the holy Scripture, and alſo of the ancient Fathers, that the true Catholike, and Apoſtolike Church, is not tied to one certaine place or nation, nor to one certaine kinde of men, but that it is in that place or nation, where the Goſpell of Chriſt is ſincerely preached, and his Sacraments rightly adminiſtred,

                     <p>Now that which is affirmed, that the Church hath authoritie to beare witneſſe of the holy Scripture, to interpret the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to judge of all doctrines, it is not ſo to be underſtood, that the Church hath abſolute authoritie to determine what ſhe liſteth, and alſo, if it pleaſe her, to change the Scripture, and to feigne a new doctrine, and to appoint new worſhips of God; but that the Church, as the Spouſe of Chriſt, ought to know the voice of her husband, and that ſhe hath received of her husband a certain rule, to wit, the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall preaching, confirmed by miracles from heaven, according to the which ſhe is bound to interpret thoſe places of the Scripture, which ſeeme to be obſcure, and to judge of doctrines. <hi>Pſal. 119.

                  <p>FVrthermore we will ſhew, what is taught among us, both<note place="margin">Artie. 15.</note> touching the Chriſtian Church, and alſo touching the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: and touching the Church, this is it that we teach. The Church or congregation of Chriſt, (which as yet is in this world as a ſtranger from God) is the fellowſhip and company of thoſe, which addict themſelves to Chriſt, and do altogether truſt and reſt in his protection: among whom notwithſtanding many ſhall be mingled, even to the end of the world, who although they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Chriſtian faith, yet they have it not in deed. This hath our Lord taught ſufficiently, Matth. 13. by the parable both <hi>of the cockle, and of the Net caſt into the ſea, in the which the bad fiſhes are caught with the good.</hi> Alſo, Matth. 22 by the parable of the King, inviting all men to the marriage of his Sonne, and afterward, <hi>caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him out, being bound hand and foot, into utter darknnes, which had not a wedding garment.</hi> Now theſe places of Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the congregation of Chriſt is commended, to be <hi>the Spouſe of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61072:133"/> Chriſt, for the which he hath given himſelfe.</hi> Eph. 5. <hi>The houſe of God, the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> 1 Tim. 3. Alſo, <hi>The holy hill of Sion, the City of the living God, the heavenly Ieruſalem, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the firſt borne, which are written in heaven:</hi> I ſay, all theſe places of Scripture do properly pertaine to them, who for their ſincere faith are truely, and in the ſight of God, reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the children of God. For ſeeing that in theſe alone the Lord doth fully reigne, theſe onely, if we will ſpeake properly, are called the Church of Chriſt, and the communion of Saints, in which ſence alſo the name of the Church is expounded, in the common Articles of faith, thoſe falſe Chriſtians being excluded, which are mingled amongſt them. Furthermore, the holy Ghoſt himſelfe doth governe this Church or congregation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth with it, as Chriſt doth even to the end of the world, and <hi>doth ſanctifie it, that at the length he may preſent it unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe without ſpot or wrinckle,</hi> as it is ſaid, Epheſ 5. Alſo this is that Church which all men are commanded to heare, and he that will not heare her, is to be counted as an Heathen and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane.</p>
                  <p>And although that, to wit, faith it ſelfe, cannot be ſeene, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this Congregation hath obtained, to be called the Church and company of Chriſt, yet the fruits of that faith may be ſeene and knowne, and of them a certaine Chriſtian conjecture be taken. Theſe fruits be chiefly, a bold profeſſion of Faith, a true love offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelfe to do humble ſervice to all men, a contempt of all things. Seeing therefore that theſe be the proper fruites, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the holy Goſpell and the Sacraments be exerciſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it may eaſily be known, where and who be the Chriſtian Church; ſo much as is neceſſary for us to preſerve among us the Chriſtian communion, and that in the ſame we may be inſtructed, admoniſhed, and help one another, according to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, ſeeing this congregation is the very kingdome of God, wherein all things ought to be appointed in beſt order, ſhe hath all kind of offices and miniſters: for ſhe is the body of Chriſt himſelfe, compacted of many members, whereof every one have their proper worke. Therefore whoſoever do faithfully diſcharge ſuch functoins, and do earneſtly labour in the word and doctrine, they do repreſent the Church, and may do all things in the name thereof, ſo that whoſoever ſhall either deſpiſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61072:134"/> them, or refuſe to heare them, he may worthily be ſaid to deſpiſe the Church it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Now with what ſpirit or with what ſpirituall authoritie we do beleeve that they are furniſhed, we have declared before, out of moſt firme foundations of the Scripture, where we ſhewed, what we thought of the ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall offices, and dignitie. For they cannot by any means repreſent the Church of Chriſt, or doe any thing in the name thereof, which are not Chriſts, and therefore propound no Chriſtian things, but whatſoever is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the doctrine of Chriſt. For although it may be, that even the wicked may teach ſome good thing, and may alſo propheſie in the name of Chriſt (after their example, to whom the Lord himſelfe doth witneſſe that he will once in time to come ſay, (<hi>That he never knew them.</hi>) Yet it cannot be, that they can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the dutie of the Church of Chriſt, and are to be heard, in his ſtead, which doe not propound the voice of their husband Chriſt, although otherwiſe they ſhould thinke aright of faith, and be counted amongſt the members of the Church, as it doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall out, when as the very children of God are wrapped in errours, and doe alſo publiſh the ſame. For the Church of Chriſt is wholly addicted to Chriſt himſelfe. Therefore that cannot be counted a doctrine, precept, or commandement of the true Church, except it be the ſame with the doctrine, precept, and commandement of Chriſt himſelfe. And whoſoever propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any other thing in her name (although he were an Angel from heaven) he is not to be heard: as alſo the Church in thoſe things doth repreſent nothing leſſe then the Church of Chriſt.</p>

Therefore the firſt beginning, inſtitution, and office of the Miniſters, is a moſt ancient ordinance of God himſelfe, not a new deviſe appointed by men. True it is, that God can by his power, without any meanes, take unto himſelfe a Church amongſt men, but he had rather deale with men by the miniſterie of men. Therefore Miniſters are to be conſidered, not as Miniſters by themſelves alone, but as the Miniſters of God, even ſuch as by whoſe meanes God doth work the ſalvation of mankinde. For which cauſe we give counſell to beware, that we doe not ſo attribute the things that appertaine to our converſion and inſtruction unto the ſecret vertue of the holy Ghoſt, that we make fruſtrate the Eccleſiaſticall miniſterie.

                     <hi>is Apollo, but the miniſters by whom ye beleeved? and as the Lord gave unto every one. Therefore neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi> Therefore let us beleeve that God doth teach us by his word outwardly by his miniſters, and doth inwardly move and perſwade the hearts of his Elect unto beliefe by his holy ſpirit: and that therefore we ought to render all the glory of this whole benefit unto God. But we have ſpoken of this matter in the 1 <hi>Chapter</hi> of this our declaration.</p>
                  <p>God hath uſed for his miniſters, even from the beginning of the world, the beſt and moſt excellent men in the world (for howſoever divers of them were but ſimple, for worldly wiſdome or Philoſophy, yet ſure in true divinitie they were moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent) namely the Patriarks, to whom he ſpake very often by his Angels. For the Patriarks were the Prophets or teachers of their age, whom God for this purpoſe would have to live many yeers, that they might be, as it were Fathers, and lights of the world. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them followed <hi>Moſes</hi> together with the Prophets, that were moſt famous throughout the whole world. Beſides after all theſe our heavenly Father hath ſent his onely begotten Sonne, the moſt abſolute and perfect teacher of the world, in whom is hidden the wiſedome of God, and from him derived unto us by that moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, perfect, and moſt pure doctrine of all other. For he choſe unto himſelfe Diſciples whom he made Apoſtles. And they going out into the whole world gathered together Churches in all places by the preaching of the Goſpel. And after they ordained paſtors and Doctors in all Churches, by the commandement of Chriſt, who by ſuch as ſucceeded them, hath taught and governed the Church unto this day. Therefore God gave unto his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people the Patriarkes, together with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61072:135"/> ſo alſo to his people under the new covenant he hath ſent his onely begotten Sonne, and with him the Apoſtles and teachers of his Church.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the Miniſters of the new covenant are tearmed by divers names, for they are called Apoſtles, Prophets, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, Biſhops, Elders, Paſtors, and Doctors. The Apoſtles remained<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. Epheſ. 4.</note> in no certaine place, but gathered together divers Churches throughout the whole world: which Churches when they were once eſtabliſhed, there ceaſed to be any more Apoſtles, and in their places were particular parſons appointed in every Church. The Prophets in old time did foreſee and foretell things to come, and beſides did interpret the Scriptures, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> and ſuch are found ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us at this day. They were called Evangeliſts, which were the penners of the hiſtory of the Goſpel, and were alſo <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> preachers of the Goſpel of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> giveth in charge unto <hi>Timothy, To fulfill the work of an Evangeliſt.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. Obſervat.</note> Biſhops were the overſeers and the watchmen of the Church, which did diſtribute food and other neceſſities of the Church. The Elders were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients and as it were the Senators and Fathers of the Church, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning it with the wholeſome counſell. The Paſtors did both keepe the Lords flock, and alſo <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 4. Obſervat.</note> provide things neceſſary for it. The Doctors doe inſtruct, and teach the true faith and godlineſſe. Therefore the Church Miniſters that now are, may be called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Elders, Paſtors and Doctors. But in proceſſe of times there were many moe names of Miniſters brought into the Church. For ſome were created Patriarks, others Archbiſhops, others Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, other Metropolitanes, Archprieſts, Deacons, Subdeacons, Acoluthes, Exorciſts, Queriſters, Porters, and I know not what a a rable beſides Cardinals, Provoſts, and Priors, Abbots greater and leſſer, governours higher and lower. But touching all theſe we paſſe not a ruſh what they have beene in time paſt, or what they are now. It is not ſufficient for us, that, foraſmuch as concerneth Miniſters, we have the doctrine of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>We therfore knowing certainly that Monks and the orders or ſorts of them are neither inſtituted of Chriſt nor of his Apoſtles, we teach that they are ſo farre from being profitable, that they are pernicious and hurtfull unto the Church of God. For although in former times they were ſomewhat tolerable (when they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſolitarily, getting their livings with their owne hands, were burdenſome to none, but did in all places obey their Paſtours,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61072:136"/> even as laie men, yet what kinde of men they be now, all the world ſeeth and perceiveth. They pretend, I know not what vowes, but they leade a life altogether diſagreeing from their vowes: ſo that the very beſt of them may juſtly be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh: <hi>We heare ſay that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>there be ſome among you which walke inordinately and worke not at all, but are buſie bodies, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore we have no ſuch in our Churches: and and beſides we teach, that they ſhould not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to rout in the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, no man ought to uſurpe the honour of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall miniſterie, that is to ſay, greedily to plucke it to him by bribes, or any evill ſhifts, or of his owne accord. But let the miniſters of the Church be called and choſen by a lawfull and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall election and vocation, that is to ſay, let them be choſen religiouſly of the Church, or of thoſe which are appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Church, and that in due order, without any tumult, ſeditions, or contention. But we muſt have an eye to this, that not every one that will, be elected, but ſuch men as are fit, and have ſufficient learning, eſpecially in the Scriptures, and godly elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and wiſe ſimplicitie, to conclude, ſuch men as be of good report for a moderation and honeſty of life, according to that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike rule which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth in the 1 to <hi>Timothy, 3. cap.</hi> and 1 to <hi>Titus.</hi> And thoſe which are choſen, let them be ordained of the Elders, with publike prayer, and laying on of hands. We doe here therefore condemne all thoſe, which runne of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord being neither choſen, ſent, nor ordained. We doe alſo utterly diſallow unfit Miniſters, and ſuch as are not furniſhed with gifts requiſite for a Paſtor. In the meane time we are not ignorant that the innocent ſimplicitie of certaine Paſtours in the Primitive Church, did ſometimes more profit the Church then the manifold exquiſite, and nice learning of other ſome, that were over loftie and high minded. And for this cauſe we alſo at this day doe not reject the honeſt ſimplicitie of certaine men, which yet is not deſtitute of all knowledge and learning.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles of Chriſt doe terme all thoſe which beleeve in Chriſt, <hi>Prieſts,</hi> but not in regard of their miniſterie, but becauſe<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 2 Pet. 1. Apoc. 1.</note> that all the faithfull being made Kings and Prieſts by Chriſt, may offer vp ſpirituall ſacrifices unto God. The miniſterie then and Prieſthood are things farre different one from the other. For Prieſthood, as we ſaid even now, is common to all Chriſtians, ſo
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61072:136"/> is not the miniſterie. And we have not taken away the miniſtery from the Church, becauſe we have thruſt the Popiſh prieſthood out of the Church of Chriſt. For ſurely in the new covenant of Chriſt, there is no longer any ſuch prieſthood, as was in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church of the Iewes, which had an externall anointing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> garments, and very many ceremonies, which were figures and tipes of Chriſt, who by his coming fulfilled and aboliſhed them. And he himſelfe remaineth the onely Prieſt for ever: and we doe not communicate the name of Prieſt to any of the miniſters, leſt we ſhould detract any thing from Chriſt. For the Lord himſelfe hath not appointed in the Church any prieſts of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who having received authoritie from the Suffragane may offer up the hoſte every day, that is, the very fleſh and the very blood of our Saviour, for the quicke and the dead, but Miniſters which may teach, and adminiſter the Sacraments. <hi>Paul</hi> declaring plainly and ſhortly, what we are to thinke of the Miniſters of the New Teſtament, or of the Church of Chriſt, and what we muſt attribute unto them, <hi>Let a man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thus account of us, as of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>the Miniſters of Chriſt, and diſpenſers of the myſteries of God.</hi> So that the Apoſtle his minde is, that we ſhould eſteeme of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as of Miniſters. Now the Apoſtle calleth them as it were underrowers, which ſhould onely have an eye unto their maſter and chiefe governour, and be as men that live not to themſelves, nor according to their owne will, but unto others, to wit, their Maſters, at whoſe commandement and becke they ought to be. For the Miniſter of the Church is commanded wholly and in all parts of his dutie, not to pleaſe himſelfe, but to execute that onely, which he hath received in commandment from his Lord. And in this ſame place, it is expreſly declared, who is our Maſter, even Chriſt, to whom the Miniſters are in ſubjection in all the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their miniſterie. And to the end that he might the more fully declare their miniſterie, he addeth further that the miniſters of the Church are <hi>ſtewards and diſpenſers of the myſteries of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> Now the <hi>myſteries of God, Paul</hi> in many places, and eſpecially in the third to the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> doth call the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> And the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Chriſt are alſo called myſteries of the ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Therefore for this purpoſe are the miniſters called, namely to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt unto the faithfull, and to adminiſter the Sacraments. We reade alſo in another place in the Goſpel, of <hi>the faithfull and wiſe ſervant, that his Lord ſet him over his family,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note>

                     <hi>to give foode unto it in due ſeaſon.</hi> Againe, (in an other place of the Goſpel) a man goeth into a ſtrange countrey, and leaving his houſe, giveth unto his ſervants authoritie therein, committeth to them his ſubſtance, and appointeth every man his worke.</p>
                  <p>This is now a fit place to ſpeake ſomewhat alſo of the power and office of the miniſters of the Church. And concerning their power, ſome have entreated and diſputed overbuſily, and would bring all things even the very greateſt under their juriſdiction, and<note place="margin">Luc. 22. Mat. 18.</note> that againſt the commandement of God who forbad unto his all dominion, and highly commendeth humilitie: indeed there is one kinde of power which is a meere and abſolute power, called the power of right. According to this power all things in the whole world are ſubject unto Chriſt, who is Lord of all: even as he himſelfe witneſſeth, ſaying: <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 28 21. Apoc. 23 and 22.</note> 
                     <hi>and in earth.</hi> And againe, <hi>I am the firſt, and the laſt, and behold I live for ever, and I have the keies of hell, and of death.</hi> Again, <hi>He hath the key of David, which openeth, and no man ſhutteth, ſhutteth, and no man openeth.</hi> This power the Lord reſerveth to himſelfe, and doth not transfer it to any other, that he might ſit idle by, and look on his miniſters while they wrought. For Iſaiah ſaith, <hi>I will put the keie of the houſe of David upon his ſhoulder.</hi> And again, <hi>Whoſe government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders.</hi> For he doth not lay the government on other mens ſhoulders, but doth ſtil keep, and uſe his own power, thereby governing all things, Furthermore, there is another power of duty, or miniſteriall power limited out by him, who hath full and abſolute power and authority. And this is more like a miniſtry then dominion. For we ſee that ſome maſter doth give unto the ſteward of his houſe authoritie and power over his houſe, and for that cauſe delivereth him his keies, that he may admit or exclude ſuch as his Maſter will have admitted, or excluded. According to this power, doth the miniſter by his office, that which the Lord hath commanded him to do, and the Lord doth ratifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that which he doth, and will have the deeds of his miniſters to be acknowledged and eſteemed as his own deeds unto which end are thoſe ſpeeches in the Goſpel: <hi>I will give unto thee the</hi>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61072:137"/> but paſſe the limits and bounds of faith, then the Lord doth make voyde that which he doth. Wherefore the Eccleſiaſticall power of the miniſters of the Church, is that function whereby they doe indeed governe the Church of God, but yet ſo as they doe all things in the Church as he hath preſcribed in his word: which thing being ſo done, the faithfull doe eſteeme them as done of the Lord himſelfe: but touching the keies we have ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Luc. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>you, let him be your ſervant:</hi> they kept in themſelves by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and did mutually aide one another in the governement and preſervation of the Church. Notwithſtanding, for orders ſake, ſome one of the miniſters, called the aſſembly together, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto the aſſembly the matters to be conſulted of, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the voyces or ſentences of the reſt, and to be briefe, as much as lay in him, provided that there might ariſe no confuſion. So did Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> as we read in the <hi>Acts:</hi> who yet for all that was neither above the reſt, nor had greater authority then the reſt. Very true therefore is that ſaying of <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Martyr, in his booke, <hi>De ſimpl. Cler. The ſame doubtleſſe were the reſt of the Apoſtles that Peter was, having an equall fellowſhip with him both in honour and power, but the beginning hereof proceedeth from unitie, to ſignifie unto us that there is but one Church.</hi> Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> upon the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> hath a ſaying not much unlike this. <hi>Before that by the inſtinct of the Devill there was partaking in religion, the Churches were governed by the common advice of the Prieſts: but after that every one thought, that thoſe whom he had baptiſed, were his owne and not Chriſts, It was decreed, that one of the Prieſts ſhould be choſen and ſet over the reſt, who ſhould have the care of the whole Church laid upon him, and by whoſe meanes all ſchiſmes ſhould be removed.</hi> Yet <hi>Jerome</hi> doth not avouch this as an order ſet downe of God. For ſtraight way after he addeth, <hi>Even as,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Prieſts knew by the continuall cuſtome of the Church, that they were ſubiect to him that is ſet over them: So the Biſhop muſt know that they are above the prieſts, rather by cuſtome, then by the preſcript
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61072:138"/> rule of Gods truth, and they ſhould have the government of the Church in common with them.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Jerome.</hi> Now therefore no man can forbid by any right that we may returne to the old appointment of God, and rather receive that, then the cuſtome deviſed by men.</p>
                  <p>The offices of the miniſters are divers, yet notwithſtanding moſt men doe reſtraine them to two, in which all the reſt are comprehended; to the teaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and to the lawfull adminiſtration of the Sacraments. For it is the dutie of the Miniſters to gather together a holy aſſembly, therein to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Word of God, and alſo to apply the generall doctrine to the ſtate and uſe of the Church, to the end, that the doctrine which they teach, may profit the hearers, and may build up the faithfull. The Miniſters dutie, I ſay, is, to teach the unlearned, and to exhort, yea and to urge them to goe forward, in the way of the Lord, who doe ſtand ſtill or linger, and goe ſlowly forward: moreover to comfort, and to ſtrengthen thoſe, which are faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, and to arme them againſt the manifold temptations of Satan, to rebuke offenders, to bring them home that goe aſtray, to raiſe them up that are fallen, to convince the gainſaiers, to chaſe away the wolfe from the Lords flocke, to rebuke wickedneſſe and wicked men, wiſely and ſeverely, not to winke at, nor to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver great wickedneſſe, and beſides to adminiſter the Sacraments, and to commend the right uſe of them, and to prepare all men by wholeſome doctrine to receive them, to keepe together all the faithfull in an holy unitie, and to meete with ſchiſmes. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, to catechiſe the ignorant, to commend the neceſſitie of the poore to the Church, to viſit and inſtruct thoſe that are ſicke or intangled with divers temptations, and ſo to keepe them in the way of life. Laſtly, to looke diligently, that there be publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſupplications made in time of neceſſitie, together with faſting, that is, an holy abſtinencie, and moſt carefully to looke to thoſe things which belongeth to tranquillity, ſafety, and peace of the Church. And to the end that the Miniſter may performe all theſe things the better, and with more eaſe, it is required in him that he be one that feareth God, pray diligently, giveth himſelfe much to the reading of the Scripture, and in all things, and at all times is watchfull, and doth ſhew forth a good example unto all men of holineſſe of life. And ſeeing there muſt needs be a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in the Church, and that among the ancient fathers excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61072:138"/> was in uſe, and there were Eccleſiaſticall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongſt the people of God, wherein this diſcipline was exerciſed by godly men, it belongeth alſo to the Miniſters dutie for the edifying of the Church, to moderate this diſcipline, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the condition of the time and publike eſtate, and according to neceſſitie: whereas this rule is alwaies to be holden, that <hi>All things ought to be done to edification, decently, honeſtly,</hi> without any oppreſſion or tumult. For the Apoſtle witneſſeth, that <hi>power was given to him of God, to edifie and not to deſtroy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.</note> And the Lord himſelfe <hi>forbad the cockle to be plucked up in the Lords field, becauſe there would be danger leſt the wheate alſo ſhould be plucked up with it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as for the errour of the Donatiſts, we doe here utterly deteſt it, who eſteemed and judged the doctrine and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments to be either effectuall, or not effectuall, by the good or evill life of the Miniſters. For we know that the voyce of Chriſt is to be heard, though it be out of the mouthes of evill Miniſters foraſmuch as the Lord himſelfe ſaid, <hi>Doe as they</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>command you, but according to their workes doe ye not.</hi> We know that the Sacraments are ſanctified by their inſtitution, and alſo by the word of Chriſt, and that they are effectuall to the Godly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be adminiſtred by ungodly Miniſters. Of which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that bleſſed ſervant of God, did reaſon diverſly out of the Scriptures againſt the Donatiſts, yet notwithſtanding there ought to be a ſtreight diſcipline amongſt the Miniſters. For there muſt be diligent enquirie in the Synods touching the life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that offend are to be rebuked of the Seniours, and to be brought into the way, if they be not paſt recovery, or elſe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and as wolves to be driven from the Lords flocke, by the true Paſtors, if they be incurable. For, if they once be falſe teachers, they are in no wiſe to be tollerated: neither doe we diſallow of generall councels, if that they be taken up according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtles, to the ſalvation of the Church and not to the deſtruction thereof.</p>
                  <p>The faithfull Miniſters alſo are worthy (as good workemen) of their reward, neither doe they offend when as they receive a ſtipend and all things that be neceſſary for themſelves and their family. For the Apoſtle ſheweth that theſe things are for juſt cauſe offered of the Church, and received of the Miniſters, they
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61072:139"/> are likewiſe of right, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. and in other places alſo.</p>
                  <p>The Anabaptiſts, likewiſe are confuted by this Apoſtolicall doctrine, who condemne and raile upon thoſe miniſters which live upon the miniſterie.</p>

Father which ſent me, doe draw him:</hi> Yet it was his will, that the Goſpel of the kingdome ſhould be preached to all nations, and that Biſhops ſhould diſcharge this dutie of the Miniſtery, with great care and diligence, and with ſpeciall watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, and by all means, to gaine many unto Chriſt. For therefore when he was ready to depart hence into heaven in his body, he ſaid to his diſciples: <hi>Got ye into the whole world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi> After the which manner alſo <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that deſcended, is even the ſame that aſcended farre above all heavens, that he might fill all things. And he gave ſome to be Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61072:140"/> and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtours, and Teachers, for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the Saints, for the worke of the miniſterie, and for the edification of the body of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Lord doth uſe theſe his Miniſters to inſtruct his Church, ſo as he uſeth meats to nouriſh us, the ſower to ſowe ſeed, and Phiſicians to heale our bodies. For except himſelfe doe give power and vertue, whereby both the meate may be turned into nouriſhment, and the ſeed may ſpring up, and alſo the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine may be made effectuall, the outward worke doth nothing at all profit: So except the Lord do give increaſe in the heart of the hearer, the doctrine indeed in him which hath not faith, is as it were a watering and planting, but ſuch as is without efficacie and unfruitfull: but being received by faith into good ground, and being trimmed by the inward husbandman the holy Ghoſt, doth worke marvellouſly, and profit. Notwithſtanding it hath ſo pleaſed the Lord to moderate the affaires of men, that although by his owne power he doth all things in all men, yet he vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth to uſe the Miniſters as workers together. For that ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> is evident: <hi>For we together are Gods labourers,</hi> but he addeth: <hi>Ye are Gods husbandrie, and Gods building:</hi> to wit, that we might give unto God all the vertue, efficacie, accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perfiting of the worke, and to the Miniſters a ſervice onely: whereupon we doe truely ſay with <hi>Paul: Who is Paul then? and who is Apollos? but the Miniſters by whom ye beleeved? and as the Lord gave to every man. I have planted, Apollos wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but God gave the increaſe. So then, neither is he that plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing, neither is he that watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi> And in this ſenſe we doe know, and willingly uſe theſe ſpeeches, and teſtimonies of the holy Scripture: <hi>I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten you in Chriſt by the Goſpel; you are the Epiſtle of Chriſt, written by us, not with inke, but with the ſpirit of the living God.</hi> And, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes you remitte, they are remitted to them.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> And againe, <hi>I ſend thee to the Gentiles, that thou maiſt open their eyes. Alſo the Scripture ſaith of Iohn Baptiſt, He ſhall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, &amp;c.</hi> For when all theſe things be done (that is, when we are borne againe, when the holy Ghoſt is given to us, when our ſinnes be forgiven us, when faith is given us, and our eies opened, and our hearts turned) <hi>one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them all,</hi> who by his grace doth lighten their hearts, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61072:141"/> draw them unto him, and that after a common order and meane, to wit, by the inſtrument or meane of his word: and yet he might draw us without all meanes, and without any inſtrument, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as much, and whom it pleaſeth him. Therefore let no man glory in men, but in him that giveth the increaſe. Againe, let no man deſpiſe men, which are ſent of the Lord, of whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me: and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> This is our opinion as touching the miniſtery of the word, agreeable, as we hope, to the Scripture and ſound wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: which alſo we have found often in <hi>Luthers,</hi> and in his friends bookes.</p>

                        <hi>Keyes of the kingdome of heaven,</hi> and theſe Keyes are the peculiar Function or Miniſterie and adminiſtration of Chriſt his power, and his holy Spirit, which power is committed to the Church of Chriſt, and to the Miniſters thereof, unto the end of the world: that they ſhould not onely by preaching publiſh the holy Goſpell, although they ſhould doe this eſpecially, that is, ſhould ſhew forth that word of true comfort, and the joyfull meſſage of peace, and new tidings of that favour which God offereth: but alſo that to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61072:143"/> the beleeving and unbeleeving they ſhould publikely or privately denounce and make knowne, to wit, to them his favour, to theſe his wrath, and that to all in generall, or to every one in particular, that they may wiſely receive ſome into the houſe of God, to the communion of Saints and drive ſome out from thence, and may ſo through the performance of their miniſterie, hold in their hand the Scepter of Chriſt his kingdome, and uſe the ſame to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt his ſheepe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the condition, and proper office of the Keyes is, firſt firſt to open and looſe, that is, in Chriſt to appeaſe and ſtill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the faithfull ones, and of thoſe that turne againe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: to make it knowne unto them that their ſins be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and to ſtrengthen them in a ſure hope of ſalvation: and by this means to open the kingdome of heaven unto them, to give them courage againſt all temptations, and to ſtirre upſtedfaſtneſſe and cheerefulneſſe in them. And all theſe things are done by the faithfull Shepheards of ſouls in the Lords ſtead, not doing this of themſelves, but upon Chriſt his commandement, not by their own and proper vertue, but by Chriſts, and by the efficacie of his Word and Sacraments, as thoſe that are Stewards and Diſpenſers of the myſteries of God, and Miniſters onely. In the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which things, they may uſe ſome ſeemely and indifferent ceremonies, that is, which are no way neceſſary, ſuch as are <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 6. obſervation. 1 Cor. 4. 2 Cor. 3. &amp; 5.</note> to lay on hands, or to reach out the right hand, or elſe they may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide the office and proper worke of the Keyes of Chriſt is, to ſhut and binde, that is, by the commandement of Chriſt, and the authoritie of this office given by him to the Church, which is his power and ſcepten, to denounce againſt all ſtubborne impenitent, unbeleeving, and other ſuch like ſinners, Gods horrible judgement and his intollerable wrath, which no nature carrabide, and his ſevere ſentence: and ſo by the word of Chriſt, according to the qualitie of the offence to reproove ſinne, to ſever them from the fellowſhip of Chriſt our Saviour, and from the fruit and participation of the Sacraments, and to caſt them out of the Chriſtian Church, and in a word to ſhut the kingdome of heaven upon them, and at the length to deliver them to Sathan.</p>
                     <p>This power of his Scepter and ſpirit hath the Lord granted and delivered to the holy Apoſtles and in them to all Miniſters of Churches, lawfully ordained that they might exerciſe in hisſtead:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61072:144"/> and he granted it to them by theſe words, <hi>As the Father hath</hi>

                  <p>We beleeve that this true Church ought to be governed by that<note place="margin">Artic. 29.</note> regiment or diſcipline, which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit ſo, that there be in it Paſtours, Elders, and Deacons, that the puritie of Doctrine may be retained, vices repreſſed, the poore, and others that be in miſerie, according to their neceſſitie, may be provided for, and that there may be holy meetings, for the edifying both of ſmall and great.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve that all true Paſtours, in what place ſoever they be<note place="margin">Artic 30.</note> placed, have the ſame, and equall authoritie among themſelves given unto them, under Ieſus Chriſt the onely head, and the chiefe and alone univerſall Biſhop, and that therefore it is not lawfull for any Church, to challenge unto it ſelfe Dominion or Soveraigntie over any other Church.</p>

                  <p>FVrthermore (we beleeve) that there be divers degrees of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Church: whereof ſome be Deacons, ſome<note place="margin">Artic. 5.</note> Prieſts, ſome Biſhops: to whom is committed the office to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the people, and the whole charge, and ſetting forth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Yet notwithſtanding, we ſay, that there neither is, nor can be any one man, which may have the whole ſuperioritie in this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall ſtate: for that Chriſt is ever preſent to aſſiſt his Church, and needeth not any man, to ſupply his roome, as his onely heire to all his ſubſtance, and that there can be no one mortall creature, which is able to comprehend, or conceive in his minde the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Church, that is to wit, all the parts of the world, much leſſe able rightly, and duely to put them in order, and to governe them. For all the Apoſtles, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, were of like power among themſelves, and the reſt were the ſame, that <hi>Peter</hi> was. And that it was ſaid indifferently to them all, <hi>Feedye:</hi> indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them all, <hi>Goe into the whole world.</hi> Indifferently to them all, <hi>Teach ye the Goſpell.</hi> And, as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>All Biſhops whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, be they at Rome, be they at Eugubium, be they at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, be they at Rhegium, be all of like preeminence, and of like Prieſthood.</hi> And, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is but one Biſhopricke, and a peece thereof is perfitly and wholly holden of every particular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</hi> And according to the judgement of the <hi>Nicene Councell,</hi> we ſay, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no more juriſdiction over the Church of God, then the reſt of the Patriarks, either of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> or of <hi>Antioch</hi> have. And as for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who now calleth all matters before himſelfe alone, except he doe his dutie, as he ought to do, except he miniſter the Sacrament, except he inſtruct the people, except he warne them and teach them, we
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61072:145"/> ſay, that he ought not of right once to be called a Biſhop, or ſo much as an Elder. For a Biſhop, as ſaith <hi>Auſtine, is a name of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and not of honour: that the man, that ſeeketh to have preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and not to profit, may underſtand, himſelfe to be no Biſhop.</hi> And that neither the Pope, nor any other worldly creature can no more be head of the whole Church, or a Biſhop over all, then he can be the Bridegroome, the light, the ſalvation, and life of the Church. For theſe priviledges, and names belong onely to Chriſt, and be properly, and onely fit for him alone. And that no Biſhop of Rome did ever ſuffer himſelfe to be called by ſuch a proud name and title, before <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperours time, (who, as we know, by killing his owne Soveraigne <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, did by a trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous villany aſpire to the Empire.) Which was about the ſixth hundred and thirteenth yeere after Chriſt was borne. Alſo the Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> did circumſpectly provide, <hi>that no Biſhop ſhould be called either the higheſt Biſhop, or chiefe Prieſt.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſithence the Biſhop of Rome will now adaies ſo be called, and challengeth unto himſelfe an authoritie, that is none of his: beſides that, he doth plainly contrary to the ancient Councels, and contrary to the old Fathers: We beleeve, that he doth give to himſelfe, as it is written by his own companion <hi>Gregory. A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, a prophane, a ſacrilegious, and an antichriſtian name: that he is alſo the King of pride, that he is</hi>

                     <hi>Lucifer, which preferreth himſelfe before his Brethren: that he hath forſaken the faith, and is the forerunner of Antichriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further we ſay, that the Miniſter ought lawfully, duely, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to be preferred to that office of the Church of God, and that no man hath power to wreſt himſelfe into the holy Miniſterie at his owne pleaſure. Wherefore theſe perſons doe us the greater wrong, which have nothing ſo common in their mouthes, as that we doe nothing orderly, and comely, but all things trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſomely, and without order: And that we allow every man to be a Prieſt, to be a Teacher, and to be an Interpreter of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Moreover we ſay, that Chriſt hath given to his Miniſters pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<note place="margin">Artic. 7.</note> to binde, to looſe, to open, to ſhut. And (we ſay) that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of looſing conſiſteth in this point: that the Miniſter, either by the preaching of the Goſpell, offereth the merits of Chriſt, and full pardon to ſuch as have lowly and contrite hearts, and doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly repent themſelves, pronouncing unto the ſame a ſure,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61072:146"/> and an undoubted forgiveneſſe of their ſins, and hope of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation: Or elſe that the ſame Miniſter, when any have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their brothers mindes with ſome great offence, or notable, and open crime, whereby they have, as it were, baniſhed, and made themſelves ſtrangers from the common followſhip, and from the body of Chriſt, then after perfit amendment of ſuch perſons, doth reconcile them, and bring them home againe, and reſtore them to the companie, and unitie of the faithfull. We ſay alſo, that the Miniſter doth execute the authoritie of binding and ſhutting, as often as he ſhutteth up the gate of the kingdome of heaven againſt unbeleeving, and ſtubborne perſons, denouncing unto them Gods vengeance, and everlaſting puniſhment: Or elſe, when he doth quite ſhut them out from the boſome of the Church, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> by open excommunication. Out of doubt, what ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſoever the Miniſter of God ſhall give in this ſort, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth ſo well allow it, that, whatſoever here in earth by their means is looſed, and bound, God himſelfe will looſe, and binde, and confirme the ſame in heaven. And touching the Keyes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they may either ſhut or open the kingdome of heaven, we with <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſay, <hi>They be the knowledge of the Scriptures:</hi> with <hi>Tertullian</hi> we ſay, <hi>They be the interpretation of the Law:</hi> and with <hi>Euſebius</hi> we call them <hi>the word of God.</hi> Moreover that Chriſts Diſciples did receive this authoritie, not that they ſhould heare the private confeſſions of the people, and liſten to their whiſperings, as the common maſſing Prieſts doe every where now a dayes, and doe it ſo, as though in that one point lay all the vertue, and uſe of the Keyes: but to the end, they ſhould goe, they ſhould teach, they ſhould publiſh abroad the Goſpell, and be unto the beleeving a ſweet ſavour of life unto life: and unto the unbeleeving, and unfaithfull, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> a ſavour of death unto death: and that the mindes of godly perſons being broght low by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of their former life and errours, after they once begun to looke up unto the light of the Goſpel, and beleeve in Chriſt, might be opened with the word of God, even as a doore is opened with a Key. Contrariwiſe, that the wicked and wilfull, and ſuch, as would not beleeve, nor returne into the right way, ſhould be left ſtill as faſt locked, and ſhut up, and, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, waxe worſe,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.</note> and worſe. This take we to be the meaning of the Keys: and that after this ſort mens conſciences be either opened, or ſhut. We ſay that the Prieſt in deed is a judge in this caſe, But yet hath no
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61072:146"/> manner of right to challenge an authoritie or power, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
                     <note place="margin">* Looke the 3. Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> ſaith. And therefore our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, to reproove the negligence of the Scribes, and Phariſees in teaching, did with theſe words rebuke them, ſaying: <hi>Woe be unto you Scribes, and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 11. Matth. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Phariſees, which have taken away the Keyes of knowledge, and have ſhut up the kingdome of heaven before men.</hi> Seeing then the Key whereby the way, and entry to the kingdome of God is opened unto us, is the word of the Goſpel, and the expounding of the Law, and Scriptures, we ſay plainly, where the ſame word is not, there is not the Key. And, ſeeing one manner of word is given<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> to all, and one onely key belongeth to all, we ſay, there is but one onely power of all Miniſters, as concerning opening, and ſhutting. And, as <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 4. Obſervat. upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion.</note> touching the Biſhop of Rome, for all that his flattering Paraſites ſing theſe words in his eares, <hi>To thee will I give the keyes of the kingdome of heaven,</hi> (as though theſe keyes were ſit for him alone, and for no body elſe) <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 4.

And although he taught, and inſtructed the people (as would God he might ofice truely doe, and perſwade himſelfe, it were at the leaſt any piece of his dutie) yet we thinke his key to be never a whit better, or of greater force, then other mens. For who hath ſevered him from the reſt? Who hath taught him more cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to open, or better to abſolve, then his brethren?</p>

And out of this confuſion there hath ſprung very great wars and tumults, while that the Popes, bearing themſelves bold upon
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61072:147"/> the power of the keyes, have not only appointed new kindes of worſhip and ſervice of God, and burdened mens conſciences by reſerving of caſes and by violent excommunications, but alſo have laboured to transferre worldly kingdomes from one to another, and to ſpoile Emperours of their power and authoritie. Theſe faults did godly and learned men long ſince reprehend in the Church, and for that cauſe, our Divines were faine, for the comfort of mens conſciences, to ſhew the difference betweene the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall and civill powers.

                        <p>Now their judgement is this, that the power of the keyes, or the power of the Biſhops, by the rule of the Goſpel, is a power, or commandement from God, of preaching the Goſpel, of remitting or retaining ſins, and of adminiſtring the Sacraments. For Chriſt doth ſend his Apoſtles with this charge, <hi>As the Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you. Receive ye the holy Ghoſt: whoſe ſins ye forgive, they are forgiven them, and whoſe ſins ye retaine, they are retained.</hi> Mar. 16. <hi>Go and preach the Goſpel to every creature, &amp;c.</hi> This power is put in execution, onely by teaching or preaching the Goſpel, and adminiſtring the Sacraments, either to many joyntly, or to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall perſons, according to their calling. For they be not corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things but eternall, that are granted unto us, as an eternall righteouſneſſe, the holy Ghoſt, life everlaſting. Theſe things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gotten but by the miniſterie of the Word and Sacraments. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that beleeveth.</hi> Seeing then that the power Eccleſiaſticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth things eternall, and is put in uſe onely by the miniſtery of the word, it hindreth not the politicall government, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation.</note> no more then doth the * skill of muſicke or ſinging.

To conclude, they tell us here, what an enemie to mankinde want of government is, and how many vices and calamities ariſing out of this fountaine, doe overflow the whole life of man.</p>
                        <p>They adviſe therefore for the avoiding of theſe ſo great evils, to eſtabliſh the authoritie of Biſhops to retaine ſtill the laws that have been in uſe before, and alſo to beare with the inconveniences (if there be any in them) in reſpect of the common weakneſſe of men, and for quietneſſe ſake to diſſemble them: eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there can no ſtate or order be appointed which is without all manner of faults.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61072:149"/> caned not for the peace and quiet of their country, or ſo barbarous and cruell, that they made no great accompt of the diſcipline, lawes, and good order of the kingdome. For thoſe moſt wiſe, vertuous, and grave men, <hi>Eſay, Ionas, Ieremy, Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> 
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Look the 7. Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                           <hi>Chriſt, Peter, Iames, and Paul,</hi> Did both know what a great good civill concord is, and loved their country and country-men, and alſo were greeved to behold the diſcords and renting a ſunder of thoſe notable common-wealthes. How often did Chriſt weep, when he ſpake of the diſcords and Tumults of his nation, and the ſacking of the City? Albeit therefore the Prophets and Apoſtles did very well know and greatly like of thoſe civill duties: Yet were they conſtrained by the commandement of God to warre againſt the divels kingdome, to preach heavenly doctrine, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a Church unto God, and to imploy their ſervice to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation of a great number of men. Theſe are the firſt lawes that ever were given, and are to be preferred before all other. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods. Thou ſhalt not take the name of God in vaine.</hi> And this concerning the ſonne, <hi>This is my beloved ſonne, heare him.</hi> Theſe lawes muſt needs be obeyed, The true doctrine of God and his true worſhip muſt needs be embraced and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and all errors, that tend to the diſhonour of God, muſt be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and forſaken, though all the world ſhould breake and fall downe. No humane thing muſt be preferred before Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, not our life, not our friends, not the concord and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grement of neighbours and countrymen. <hi>Moſes</hi> a very wiſe man, &amp; no doubt a politick man, layeth upon the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> the charg of teaching and knowing what great conflicts and dangers teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall meete withall, he forewarneth them of that which he tooke to be moſt difficult of all other. And chargeth them that the defence of true doctrine be moſt deare unto them, for ſo he ſaith, Deut. 33. <hi>Theſe ſhall keepe thy word, and ſhall forget their Parents, children, and brethren.</hi> And hereof we have experience, that it is no ſmall burden that is laid upon the teachers of the word. Our men are cruelly dealt with in many places. We are ſore oppreſſed, and the diſcord in our country bringeth no ſmall griefe unto us. But, as was ſaid before, the commandement of God concerning the embracing of the true doctrine of God and renouncing of errours, muſt be preferred before theſe great inconveniences, We are not ignorant what wiſe men have written, of changing and altering lawes. We remember well the ſaying of Plato <hi>that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61072:149"/> as the manners of doting parents, ſo the cuſtomes and faſhions of our country, though none of the wiſeſt, are to be borne with all,</hi> But theſe precepts have their bounds and limits, within which they muſt be reſtrained. Bondage without impiety may be borne, but Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not to be borne with, nor the light of the Goſpell to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.</p>
                        <p>Againe, why do our adverſaries declaime of ſuch a modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto us, when as they in the meane while murder the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and members of Chriſt? They might eaſily eſtabliſh peace, and maintaine the author of good order, if they would aboliſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and unjuſt lawes. But now they contend not for the ſafety of the Church, but for their owne profits and pleaſures. They would not have the Idolatry of the Maſſe nor praying to the dead ſpoken againſt: becauſe they cannot abide that their gaine ſhould decreaſe. They forbid wandring luſts, becauſe the unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtate is beſt for the keeping of their goods. Theſe things are in all mens eyes. Therefore let them leave of their Senator like invectives wherein to uſe the old Poets words <hi>under a faire colour they ſeeke to eſtabliſh ſhameleſſe facts.</hi> Hereto I adjoyne alſo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of our defence both true and unfeigned. We doe not ſhake of government to bring in diſorder. We teach that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Goſpel is moſt highly to be reverenced and obeyed in thoſe things, which (according to the goſpel) do properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the miniſtery thereof. And he is a wicked and an accurſed wretch, that doth not with reverence entertaine as <hi>moſt beautifull the feet of ſuch as bring tiding of peace.</hi> And as for the civill power, which beareth the ſword, it hath been highly commended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in our writings. Wherefore it is a vile ſlaunder that they object againſt us, that we be enemies of government.</p>

For theſe ſayings do not allot unto Biſhops a kingdome without the Goſpell. Chriſt gave them certaine commandements, and thoſe he will have us
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61072:150"/> obey. Againe he forbad that any new found worſhip ſhould be ſet up in the Church, and ſuch he will not have us yeeld unto. There are certaine bonds and limits prefixed, within which both the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours authority and our obedience muſt containe it ſelfe. But theſe limites do thoſe Biſhops moſt malapertly remove, who proudly challenge to themſelves a triple power, whereby they eſtabliſh moſt pernicious errours; to wit, a Princely and ſupream power of interpreting the Scriptures. Secondly a power of erecting new worſhip and ſervice of God. Thirdly, a ſoveraigne power of making new lawes. And thus they trans, forme the Church into an humane government. They imagine, forſooth, that as the Prince or higheſt Iudge in a Realme is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the law, and as the Prince hath power to make new lawes ſo the Biſhops muſt have a power in the Church, not unlike that. And they cannot abide that the Church ſhould be governed by the dumbe writings (as they call them) of the Prophets and Apoſtles, which becauſe ſometime they ſcarſe make the matter plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, which they do ſet down, the ambiguity breedeth diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſcords. Here therefore there muſt needs be ſay they a definitive voice of ſome ſoveraigne or high Iudge, to interpret that which is ambiguous and doubtfully written. And except all be tied to ſtand to their interpretation, there will be no end of ſtrife and controverſies. Againe, unleſſe they may according as times and occaſions require make lawes, what a diſorder would there follow? Theſe things are ſet out with bigge words, and they carry a ſhew of probability in them, becauſe they are in imitation of the civill government. And ſurely ſuch conceits as theſe, have in all ages, from the beginning of the world, hurt the Church greatly and ſtill will hurt it. The godly are therefore to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that they be not overtaken with theſe ſubtilties &amp; ſleights. God will have his Church governed by his word, which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have left unto the Church, and he will have this his voice to ſound in the Church by the mouthes of his miniſters. And though it do containe a wiſdome, that is farre from reaſons reach, yet the word of the Prophets and Apoſtles is ſure and not doubtfull. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye do well in attending to the word of the Prophets, as to a light in the darknes.</hi> Beſides the Church hath the gift of interpretation, that is, the underſtanding of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly doctrine, but that is not tyed to the name or degree of Biſhops: and therefore it is no power of interpreting like to the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61072:150"/> power of a Prince or higheſt Iudge. But thoſe that are learned in the word of God and born again by his ſpiritin what place ſoever they be, they aſſent unto the word of God, and underſtand the ſame, ſome more ſome leſſe. Men muſt therefore judge wiſely of thoſe huge Bulwarkes of the peoples power. Touching lawes, to be made by the Biſhops, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in a word, <hi>Why doe ye tempt God, laying a yoke on them, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>IT is evident by the holy Scriptures, that all they which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed<note place="margin">Artic. 20.</note> Chriſtians, are conſecrated in baptiſme by Chriſt the Son of God, to be ſpirituall prieſts, and that they ought alwaies to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up to God ſpirituall ſacrifices. Neither is it unknowne, that Chriſt in his Church hath inſtituted miniſters, who ſhould preach his Goſpel, and adminiſter the Sacraments. Neither is it to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to every one, although he be a ſpirituall prieſt, to uſurpe a publike miniſterie in the Church, without a lawfull calling. For <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let all things be done honeſtly and decently among you.</hi> And againe, <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man.</hi> Wherefore we doe not account it an unprofitable thing, to prove, as it were by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſteps, the faith of them that are to be admitted to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like miniſterie of the Goſpel. And it ſeemeth not a little to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concord and unitie, to keepe a due order among the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But the holy Scripture doth not teach us, that Chriſt hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in his Church ſuch prieſts, as ſhould be Mediatours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and men, and pacifie the wrath of God towards men, by their ſacrifices, and apply the merit of Chriſt to the quick and the dead, without the preaching of the Goſpel, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments. For if we will ſpeake of the great and true Mediatour, <hi>There is but one Mediatour betweene God and men, Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne of God</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. Obſervat. upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note>. If we will ſpeake of the Mediatour of praying every godly man is made a Mediatour each for other through Ieſus, becauſe that their dutie doth require, that they ſhould commend one anothers health to God in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: the which dutie alſo then every one doth performe, when they ſay the Lords prayer in faith. If we ſpeake of the ſacrifices which doe purge our ſinnes, and appeaſe the wrath of God, then
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61072:151"/> is there one onely ſacrifice, which doth purge us, and reconcile God unto us, to wit, the ſacrifice of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which was once made on the Croſſe. And as Chriſt doth die no moe, death hath no more Dominion over him, ſo this ſacrifice of his ſhall never be made againe, but <hi>by his one oblation,</hi> as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, He hath made perfect for ever thoſe that be ſanctified.</hi> If we ſpeake of the remembrance of this one ſacrifice, and of the applying of the merit thereof, then the publike miniſters of the Church, which doe teach the Goſpel pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, and adminiſter the Sacraments according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, doe not onely make a true and right remembrance of this purging ſacrifice, but doe alſo apply, by their diſpenſation, the merit of this ſacrifice to all thoſe, that doe receive the Goſpel and the Sacraments by faith. Therefore we cannot ſee what uſe there is of thoſe kinde of men in the Church, which are ordained for this purpoſe, that they may have authoritie to ſacrifice for the quicke and the dead. <hi>Paul,</hi> when as in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> and <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he rehearſeth thoſe offices and miniſteries which are neceſſary to the edifying and preſerving of the Church, he reckoneth Prophets, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Doctors, and ſuch like: but in this rehearſall he maketh no mention at all of private Prieſts, of which ſort the world is now full: neither is it like that he would have omitted this kinde of Prieſts, if either Chriſt had appointed it, or if it had been profitable and neceſſary for the Church: And <hi>Paul</hi> writeth that a Biſhop ought to be <hi>apt to teach:</hi> And <hi>Jerome</hi> teacheth that <hi>A Prieſt and a Biſhop are all one.</hi> Therefore it is evident, that except a <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2.

Furthermore theſe be they, which doe miniſter unto us the dead letter (that is, ſuch a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of truth, as pearceth no further then to humane reaſon) but the ſpirit which quickneth, and doth ſo pearce into our ſpirit and ſoule, that it doth throughly perſwade our heart of the truth.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hereof it is manifeſt, that the true and fit Miniſters of the Church (ſuch as be Biſhops, Seniors, annointed and conſecrated) can doe nothing but in reſpect of this, that they be ſent of God. <hi>For how ſhall they preach</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) except they be ſent?</hi> That is, except they receive of God both a minde, and power to preach the holy Goſpel aright and with fruite, and to feed the flocke of Chriſt. And alſo, except they receive the holy Ghoſt, who may worke together with them, and perſwade mens hearts. Other vertues where with theſe men muſt be endued are rehearſed, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. Tit.</hi> 1. Therefore they which are in this ſort ſent, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, conſecrated and qualified, they have an earneſt care for the flocke of Chriſt, and doe labour faithfully in the word and doctrine, that they may feede the people more fruitfully: and theſe are acknowledged and accounted, of our preachers for ſuch
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61072:152"/> Biſhops, as the Scripture every where ſpeaketh of: and every Chriſtian ought to obey their commandements. But they which give themſelves to other things, they place themſelves in other mens ſeats, and doe worthily take unto themſelves other names. Yet notwithſtanding the life of any man is not ſo much to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as that therefore a Chriſtian ſhould refuſe to heare him, if peradventure he teach ſomething out of the chaire of <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> (that is, either out of the Law of God, or out of the holy Goſpel) that may ſerve for edification. They which bring a divers or a ſtrange voice, whatſoever they be, they are in no account or eſtimation, with the ſheepe of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. <note n="*" place="margin">Looke before the third Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Auguſt. confeſsion.

                  <p>Theſe things doe our Preachers teach, touching the authoritie of Eccleſiaſticall perſons: ſo that they have great injurie offered to them in that they are blamed, as though they ſought to bring the authoritie of Eccleſiaſticall Prelats to nothing, whereas they never forbad them that worldly government and authority, which they have. But they have often wiſhed, that they would come neerer to the Eccleſiaſticall commandements, and that either they themſelves would inſtruct and faithfully feed the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſtians, out of the holy Goſpel, or that at the leaſt-wiſe they would admit others hereunto, and ordain ſuch as were more fit for this purpoſe. This is it, I ſay, that our Preachers have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times requeſted of the Prelates themſelves, ſo farre they have beene from oppoſing themſelves at any time to their ſpirituall authoritie.</p>
                  <p>But whereas we could not either beare any longer the doctrine of certaine Preachers, but being driven thereunto by neceſſitie, we have placed others in their roome: or elſe have retained thoſe alſo, which have renounced that Eccleſiaſticall ſuperioritie: We did it not for any others cauſe but for that theſe did plainely and faithfully declare the voyce of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the other did mingle therewith all mans inventions. For ſo often as the queſtion is, concerning the holy Goſpel, and the doctrine of truth, Chriſtians muſt wholly turne themſelves to the Biſhop of their ſoules the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and not admit the voyce of any ſtranger by any meanes, wherein notwithſtanding neither we,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61072:152"/> nor they doe offer violence to any man: for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>All things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, whether they be things preſent, or things to come, even all are yours, and ye Chriſts, and Chriſt Gods.</hi> Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are ours, and we are not theirs, but Chriſts, and that after the ſame manner, that Chriſt himſelfe is his Fathers, to wit, that in all things, which we are, or may be, we might live to him alone. Furthermore, ſeeing to this end we have power to uſe all things (yea even men themſelves of what ſort ſoever they be) as though they were our owne, and are not to ſuffer that any man, or any thing ſhould hinder us therein, no Eccleſiaſticall perſon may juſtly complaine of us, or object to us, that we are not ſufficient by obedient to them, or that we doe derogate any thing from their authoritie, ſeeing that the thing it ſelfe doth witneſſe, that we have attempted and done all thoſe things according to the will of God, which we have attempted againſt the will of Eccleſiaſticall perſons. Theſe therefore be thoſe things, which we teach, touching the office, dignitie, and power of the Miniſters of the Church, whom they call Spirituall: the which that we may credit, we are moved thereunto by thoſe places of Scripture, which for the moſt part we rehearſed before.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD even from the beginning added unto the preaching of the Word his Sacraments or ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſignes in his Church. And this doth the holy Scripture plainely teſtifie. Sacraments be myſticall ſignes or holy rites or ſacred actions or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God himſelfe, conſiſting of his word, of outward ſignes and of things ſignified: whereby he keepeth in continuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie and eftſoones calleth to minde in his Church his great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits beſtowed upon man, and whereby he ſealeth up his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and outwardly repreſenteth and as it were offereth unto our ſight thoſe things which inwardly he performeth unto us, and therewithall ſtrengthneth and increaſeth our faith though the working of Gods Spirit in our hearts: laſtly, whereby he doth ſeparate us from all other people and religions, and conſecrateth and bindeth us wholly unto himſelfe, and giveth us to underſtand what he requireth of us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Sacraments are either of the Old Teſtament or of the New. The Sacraments of the Old Teſtament were circumciſion, and the Paſchall Lambe, which was offered up in ſacrifice and for that cauſe is referred to the ſacrifices which were in uſe from the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61072:153"/> beginning of the world. The Sacraments of the New Teſtament, are Baptiſme and the Supper of the Lord. Some there are which reckon ſeven Sacraments of the New Teſtament. Of which number we grant that repentance, matrimonie and the ordination of miniſters (we meane not the Popiſh but the Apoſtolicall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) are very profitable ordinances of God but no Sacraments. As for confirmation and extreame unction, they are meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of men, which the Church may very well want without any damage or diſcommoditie at all: and therefore we have them not in our Churches, becauſe there be certaine things in them which we can at no hand allow of. As for that merchandiſe which the Romiſh Prelates uſe in miniſtring their Sacraments we utterly abhorre it. The authour and inſtitutor of all Sacraments is not any man, but God alone, for men can by no meanes ordain Sacraments, becauſe they belong to the worſhip of God, and it is not for man to appoint and preſcribe a ſervice of God, but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and retaine that which is taught unto him by the Lord. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ſacramentall ſignes have Gods promiſes annexed to them which neceſſarily require faith, now faith ſtayeth it ſelfe onely upon the word of God. And the word of God is reſembled to writings or letters, the Sacraments to ſeales, which the Lord alone ſetteth to his owne letters: Now as the Lord is the Author of the Sacraments, ſo he continually worketh in that Church, where they be rightly uſed, ſo that the faithfull when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them of the Miniſters doe know that the Lord worketh in his owne ordinance, and therefore they receive them as from the hand of God: and the Miniſters faults (if there be any notorious in them) cannot hurt them ſeeing they doe acknowledge the goodneſſe of the Sacraments to depend upon the ordinance of the Lord. For which cauſe they put a difference in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, betweene the Lord and the Lords miniſters, confeſſing that the ſubſtance of the Sacraments is given them of the Lord, and the outward ſignes by the hands of the miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Now the principall thing, that in all the Sacraments is offered of the Lord, and chiefly regarded of the godly of all ages (which which ſome have called the ſubſtance and matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) is Chriſt our Saviour, <hi>That onely ſacrifice and the Lambe of God ſlaine from the beginning of the world, the rocke alſo of which all our fathers dranke, by whom all the elect are circumciſed with circumciſion made without hands, through the holy ſpirit,</hi> and are
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61072:154"/> waſhed from all their ſinnes, and are nouriſhed with the very body and blood of Chriſt unto eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Now in reſpect of that, which is the chiefe thing, and the very matter and ſubſtance of the Sacraments, the Sacraments of both the Teſtaments are equall. For Chriſt the onely Mediatour and Saviour of the faithfull is the chiefe thing and ſubſtance in them both, one and the ſame God is authour of them both. They were given unto both Churches, as ſignes and ſeales of the grace and promiſes of God, which ſhould call to minde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the memorie of Gods great benefits to them, and ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the faithfull from all the religions in the world: laſtly, which ſhould be received ſpiritually by faith, and ſhould binde the receivers unto the Church, and admoniſh them of their dutie: In theſe, I ſay, and ſuch like things, the Sacraments of both Churches be not unequall, although in the outward ſignes they be diverſe.</p>
                  <p>And indeed we doe yet put a greater difference betweene them: for ours are more firme and durable, as thoſe which are not to be changed to the end of the world. Againe, ours teſtifie that the ſubſtance and promiſe is alreadie fulfilled and performed in Chriſt, whereas the other did onely ſignifie that they ſhould be performed. And ours are more ſimple, and nothing painefull, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſumptuous, nor ſo full of ceremonies: Moreover they belong to a greater people, that is diſperſed through the face of the whole earth. Againe, becauſe they are more excellent, and doe (by the Spirit of God) ſtirre up in us a greater meaſure of faith, therefore a more plentifull meaſure of the ſpirit doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of them.</p>
                  <p>But now ſince that Chriſt the true Meſſias is exhibited unto us, and the abundance of grace is powred forth upon the people of the New Teſtament, the Sacraments of the old law are ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abrogated and ceaſed, and in their ſtead the Sacraments of the New Teſtament are placed: namely, for Circumciſion, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, and for the Paſchall Lambe and Sacrifices, the Supper of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And as in the old Church the ſacraments conſiſted of the word, the ſigne, and the thing ſignified, ſo even at this day they ſtand as it were of the ſame parts. For the word of God maketh them Sacraments, which before were none: for they are conſecrated by the word, and declared to be ſanctified by him who who firſt
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61072:154"/> ordeined them. To fanctiſſe or conſecrate a thing, is to dedicate it unto God and unto holy uſes, that is, to take it from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinarie uſe, and to appoint it to ſome holy uſe. For the ſignes that be in the Sacraments are drawne from common uſe, to things eternall and inviſible. As in baptiſme the outward ſigne is the element of water, and that waſhing is viſible, which is done by the Miniſter. The thing <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> ſignified is regeneration, and the cleanſing from ſinne. Likewiſe in the Lords Supper, the outward ſigne is bread and wine, taken from things commonly uſed for meate and drinke. The thing ſignified is <hi>the body of Chriſt, which was given, and his bloud which was ſhed for us,</hi> and the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body and bloud of the Lord: wherefore, the water, bread, and wine, conſidered in their owne nature, and out of this holy uſe and inſtitution of the Lord, they are onely that which they are called, and which they were ſaid then to be. But let the word of God be once added to them together with invocation upon his holy name, and the renewing of their firſt inſtitution and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and then theſe ſignes are conſecrated and declared to be ſanctified by Chriſt. For Chriſts firſt inſtitution and conſecration of the Sacraments ſtandeth yet in force in the Church of God, in ſuch ſort that they which celebrate the ſacraments, no otherwiſe then the Lord himſelfe from the beginning hath appointed, have ſtill even to this day the uſe and benefit of that firſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent conſecration. And for this cauſe in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments the very words of Chriſt are repeated. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as we learne out of the word of God, that theſe ſignes were appointed unto an other end and uſe, then commonly they are uſed unto, therefore we teach that they now in this their holy uſe doe take upon them the names of things ſignified, and are not ſtill called bare water, bread or wine, but water is called regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and <hi>waſhing of the new birth,</hi> and the bread and wine the body and bloud of the Lord, or the pledges and Sacraments of his body and bloud, not that the ſignes are turned into the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, or ceaſe to be that which in their owne nature they are, (for then they could not be Sacraments, which ſhould conſiſt onely of the thing ſignified, and have no ſignes) but therefore doe the ſignes beare the names of the things, becauſe they be my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall tokens of holy things: and becauſe that the ſignes and the things ſignified are ſacramentally joyned together: joyned together, I ſay, or united by a myſticall ſignification, and by the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61072:155"/> purpoſe and will of him, who firſt inſtituted them. For the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bread and wine, are not common, but holy ſignes. And he that inſtituted water in Baptiſme, did not inſtitute it with that minde and purpoſe, that the faithfull ſhould onely be dipped in the water of baptiſme: and he which in the Supper commanded the bread to be eaten, and the wine to be drunke, did not meane that the faithfull ſhould onely receive bread and wine, without any further myſtery, as they eate bread at home in their owne houſes: but that they ſhould ſpiritually be partakers of the things ſignified, and by faith be truely purged from their ſinne and be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſt alſo.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we cannot allow of them which attribute the conſecration of the Sacraments to I know not what ſyllables, to the rehearfall of certaine words pronounced by him that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, and that hath an intent of conſecrating, or to ſome other accidentall things, which are not left unto us either by the word, of by the example of Chriſt or his Apoſtles. We doe alſo miſlike the doctrine of thoſe, that ſpeake no other wiſe of the Sacraments then of common ſignes, not ſanctified, nor effectuall. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them alſo, who becauſe of the inviſible things doe deſpiſt the viſible ſignes, and thinke them ſuperfluous, becauſe they doe alreadie enjoy the things themſelves: ſuch were the Meſſalians, as it is recorded. We doe diſallow their doctrine alſo, who teach that grace and the things ſignified are to be ſo tied and included in the ſignes, that whoſoever doe outwardly receive the ſignes, muſt needs inwardly participate the grace and the things ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what manner of men ſoever they be.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding as we eſteeme not the goodneſſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments by the worthineſſe or unworthineſſe of the Miniſters, ſo likewiſe we doe not weigh them by the condition of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers. For we know that the goodneſſe of the Sacraments doth depend upon the faithfulneſſe or truth and the meere goodneſſe of God. For even as Gods word remaineth the true word of God, wherein not onely bare words are uttered when it is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but there withall the things ſignified by the words are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, although the wicked and unbeleevers heare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words, yet they enjoy not the things ſignified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they receive them not by a true faith: Even ſo the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſiſting of the word, the ſignes, and the things ſignified, continue true and perfect Sacraments, not onely becauſe they be
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61072:155"/> holy things, but alſo for that God alſo offereth the things ſignified, howſoever the unbeleevers receive not the things which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. This cernmeth to paſſe, not by any fault in God, the author and offerer of them, but by the fault of men, who doe receive them without faith, and unlawfully, <hi>whoſe unbeliefe cannot make</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, foraſmuch as in the beginning, where we ſhewed what the Sacraments were, we did alſo by the way ſet downe to what end they were ordained, it ſhall not be neceſſary to trouble our ſelves with repeating any thing which hath beene already hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Next therefore in order it remaineth to ſpeake ſeverally of the Sacraments of the new Teſtament.</p>

                  <p>THe ſignes, which in the Church of Chriſt be called Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Artic. 20.</note> are two, Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper. Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tokens of ſecret things, doe not conſiſt of bare ſignes, but of ſignes and things alſo. For in Baptiſme water is the ſigne, and * the thing it ſelfe is regeneration, and to be taken by adoption to be the people of God. In the Lords Supper, bread and wine be the ſignes, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. &amp; 2. Obſer. upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion.</note> but the thing is the communication of the body of Chriſt, ſalvation purchaſed for us, and the remiſſion of ſinnes. Theſe things are received by faith, as the ſignes be received with the corporall mouth, and the whole fruit of the Sacraments is in the thing it ſelfe. Whereupon we affirme that Sacraments are not onely tokens of humane ſocietie, but alſo pledges of the grace of God, by which the Miniſters doe worke together with the Lord (to that end, which he doth promiſe, offer, and bring to paſſe) yet ſo (as we ſaid before of the miniſterie of the word) that all the ſaving power is to be aſcribed to the Lord alone.</p>

                     <head>Out of the declaration of the ſame Confeſſion. Of holy ſignes.</head>
                     <p>SAcraments are viſible paterns, inſtituted of God, of the grace, good will, and promiſes of God towards us, ſure teſtimonies, and holy remembrances, the which under earthly ſignes doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto us, and ſet before our eyes heavenly gifts, and doe
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61072:156"/> withdraw the minde from earthly to heavenly things moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they be tokens of Chriſtian brotherhood and fellowſhip. Therefore a Sacrament is not onely a ſigne, but it is made of two things, to wit, of a viſible or earthly ſign, and of the thing ſignified, which is heavenly: the which two although they make but one Sacrament, yet it is one thing which is received with the body, another thing which the faithfull minde, being taught by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, doth receive. For the ſignes and the things ſignified by the ſignes doe cleave together onely by a certaine myſticall meane, or as others ſpeake, by a Sacramentall union: neither be they ſo made one, that one in nature is made the other, or that one is contained in the other. For either of them (the which thing alſo holy <hi>Gelaſius</hi> did acknowledge) doth keepe it owne proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Therefore the outward ſignes are not the ſelfe ſame thing, ſubſtantially and naturally, which they doe ſignifie, neither doe they give it of themſelves, and by their owne power, no more then the miniſter doth, but the Lord uſeth the miniſter, and the ſignes, and the word to this end, that of his meere grace, when and ſo much as pleaſeth him, he may repreſent, declare, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now, as it doth derogate nothing from the miniſterie of the word, when it is ſaid, that the out ward preaching of the word doth profit nothing, except the inward husband man doe give the increaſe, (for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that planteth, and he that watereth, is nothing, but God that giveth the increaſe,</hi>) ſo he doth not make the Sacraments of no effect, which ſaith, that not they, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth purge us, that is, which doth attribute the force of the Sacrament to the Creator. For <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Baptiſme doth ſave us:</hi> but he addeth, <hi>Not whereby the filth of the fleſh is waſhed away, but in that a good conſcience maketh requeſt unto God.</hi> For as in other creatures, as in the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres, fire, precious ſtones, hearbes, and ſuch like things, which God doth uſe as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments toward us, we ought not to put any confidence, nor admire them as the cauſes of any benefit: ſo our truſt ought not to reſt in outward ſignes, nor the glory of God be transferred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as they be outward ſignes (howbeit the Lord doth uſe their helpe toward us, and they be holy ordinances) but by them our truſt muſt lift up it ſelfe to him, beeing both the authour of the Sacraments, and the Creator of all things. And ſeeing that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61072:156"/> the Sacraments are the inſtitution and worke of the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the faithfull doe receive them, not as certaine ſuperfluous inventions of men, as at the hand of men, but as his heavenly gifts, and that at the hand of the Lord. For as touching the word of the Goſpel, which he preached, the Apoſtle writeth thus: <hi>When ye received of us the word, whereby ye learned God, ye did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as the word of men, but, as it was indeed, as the word of God, who alſo worketh in you that beleeve.</hi> The like reaſon is there of the Sacraments. Therefore as a little before we teſtified, that we doe, and alwaies did receive theſe ſentences and ſpeeches of Scripture, touching the miniſtery of the word, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. upon this confeſſion.</note> the Miniſter doth convert, remit ſins, open the eies and hearts of men, give faith and the ſpirit: ſo, being well underſtood, we doe acknowledge alſo theſe ſpeeches touching the Sacraments, the Miniſter through Baptiſme doth regenerate and waſh away ſinnes: he doth diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and give the body and blood of the Lord: For <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaid to <hi>Paul, Ariſe and be baptiſed, waſh away thy ſinnes, by calling on the name of Ieſus.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Ieſus tooke bread, gave it to his Diſciples, and ſaid, this is my body.</hi> Alſo it is manifeſt, that the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did uſe ſuch kinde of ſpeeches, becauſe that by this meanes they would propound and commend more royally the gifts of God. Moreover, ſeeing that the inſtitution and work of the word and of the Sacraments proceedeth not from men, but from God, we doe here reject the errour of the Donatiſts, and of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, who eſteemed the holy gifts of God according to the worthineſſe, or unworthineſſe of the Miniſter.</p>
                     <p>Now in that heavenly gifts are repreſented unto us by earthly things, it cometh ſo to paſſe by a certaine ſingular goodneſſe of God, who by this meane would helpe our weakeneſſe. For the weakeneſſe of mans wit doth underſtand all things the better, if they be reſembled by viſible things. Therefore the Lord would by Sacraments ſet before the eies of mortall men his heavenly gifts and his promiſes, as it were a lively picture in a certaine ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: that is, thoſe things, which are perceived by the minde, he delivered to us in ſenſible things.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon we doe gather, that the Sacraments doe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to them which are in the Church. For prophane men doe ſcoffe at our Sacraments, inſomuch as they eſteeme them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the externall things onely. But they which have faith, underſtand the myſteries of the Sacraments: and they which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61072:157"/> them in a true and lively faith, receive them with fruit: if they be received without faith, they doe hurt: not that the good gifts of God doe hurt of themſelves, but becauſe that they being not received aright, doe hurt, through our default. Furthermore, the Sacraments are badges of the people of God. For by theſe we are gathered together into a holy companie, and we profeſſe our faith. For it pleaſed the Lord by this meane to gather his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to himſelfe, and as it were to marke them with this ſigne, whereby alſo he might put every one in minde of his dutie.</p>
                     <p>Now of this kinde there be two Sacraments in the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> which is called <hi>the font of regeneration: and the Supper of the Lord, which is called the body and blood of the Lord, or the communion of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> And now we will ſpeake ſeverally of them: for hitherto we have diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Sacraments in generall, as before God we doe beleeve, and wherein we hope that <hi>Luther</hi> will not thinke any thing wanting.</p>

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61072:157"/> word, ſo by the adminiſtration of the viſible Sacraments and the myſteries thereof, faith might be helped and furthered, and that there might be an aſſured teſtimonie and confirmation of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable and well pleaſed will of God towards us, and that they might give witneſſe to that truth which is ſignified by them, and ſhould reach it out (as doth the word) to be apprehended by faith, and that the mindes of the faithfull, in the receiving of them, ſhould by faith receive the grace and truth whereof they be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and applying it unto themſelves, ſhould make it their own, and confirme themſelves therein, and on the other ſide, by giving themſelves to God, ſhould conſecrate, and as it were by an oath religiouſly binde themſelves, to ſerve him alone, and as it were be joyned together among themſelves, by the joyning and knitting, as of one ſpirit, ſo alſo of one body, to wit, of the Church,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> of the fellowſhip of Saints, and of love.</p>
                  <p>And according to theſe things, the Sacraments (as in times paſt Circumciſion was) may be called the holy covenants of God<note place="margin">Gen. 15.</note> with his Church, and of the Church with God, the Miniſters of faith and love, by which the joyning and union of God and Chriſt our Lord; with theſe beleeving people, and theirs againe with Chriſt, is made and perſited, and that among themſelves in one ſpirituall body of the Church: by which alſo, even as by the word, Chriſt, and his ſpirit do cauſe in the faithfull, that is, in thoſe that uſe them worthily, a precious participation of his excellent merit, neither doth he ſuffer them to be onely bare and naked miniſters and ceremonies, but thoſe things that they ſignifie and witneſſe outwardly, that doth he worke inwardly, to ſalvation, profitably and effectually: that is, he cleanſeth, nouriſheth, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, looſeth, payeth, remitteth, and confirmeth.</p>
                  <p>They therefore which contemn theſe Sacraments, and through ſtubbornneſſe will not ſuffer them to be of any force with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and making ſmall account of them, doe eſteeme them as trifles, or do otherwiſe abuſe them, contrary to the inſtitution, will, or commandement of Chriſt, all theſe do grievouſly ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the author thereof, who hath inſtituted them, and make a very great hazard of their ſalvation. But if ſome man would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly uſe theſe Sacraments according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, and yet cannot have leave <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> either intirely, or without deceit, ſo to doe as he would, as if peradventure one that is taken be kept in priſon, or if one ſhould be hindred by ſlekneſſe, or ſhould
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61072:158"/> live in ſtrange countries among the enemies of the truth: ſuch a man, in ſuch a caſe, if he doe wholly and truely beleeve the holy Goſpel, may by that faith be ſaved, although he have not the uſe of the Sacraments: wherefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon <hi>Iohn cap.</hi> 16. hath this worthy ſaying, <hi>Beleeve, and thou haſt eaten:</hi> ſeeing that the Sacraments are not neceſſary to ſalvation, but only by the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a certaine condition.</p>
                  <p>Alſo we teach this, that the Sacraments of themſelves, or by their owne vertue, for the workes ſake, or for the onely outward action, that is, for the bare participation, receiving and uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, cannot give grace, nor a juſtifying or quickning faith to any, which before was not inwardly quickned by the holy Ghoſt, and hath no good motion within himſelfe: I ſay, the Sacraments cannot give to any ſuch either grace, or juſtifying and quickning faith, and therefore they cannot juſtifie any man, nor inwardly quicken or regenerate any mans ſpirit: for faith muſt goe before, whereby the holy Ghoſt doth inwardly quicken, and lighten man, and ſtirre up or cauſe good motions in the heart. Without this faith there is neither any juſtification nor ſalvation: neither doe the Sacraments of, or by themſelves helpe any whit hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as in the holy Scripture manifeſt examples of this matter are found in many places, eſpecially in <hi>Judas,</hi> who received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord Chriſt himſelfe, did alſo execute the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Iohn 13.</note> of a Preacher, and yet he ceaſed not to remaine a devill, an hypocrite, and the loſt ſonne: neither was he made better by the Sacrament, or by the uſe thereof, neither did this profit him any<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> thing to ſalvation. Alſo in <hi>Ananias</hi> and his wife, who had been baptized of. Apoſtles, and had alſo without doubt received the Lords Supper, and yet not withſtanding they did continue in their wickedneſſe, injuſtice, and lies againſt the holy Ghoſt, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did neither take away their wickedneſſe, nor give them the ſaving or juſtifying faith, which maketh the heart the better by repenting, and giveth it to God an upright &amp; obedient heart, and doth appeaſe the conſcience. Therefore the Sacraments did not give this conſcience and this faith unto, them: as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and the Sacrifices of the Old Teſtament, did not give a lively and juſtifying faith, without the which faith thoſe things availed nothing to eternall ſalvation or juſtification. And ſo doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeake of all thoſe things in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> and bringeth in the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:61072:158"/> that he had faith and righteouſneſſe, which is availeable with God, before that he was circumciſed. In like ſort he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the people of <hi>Iſrael, that they alſo were baptized, and they all did eate one and the ſame ſpirituall meate, and did all drinke one and the ſame ſpirituall drinke: but with many of them God was not pleaſed.</hi> And therefore, even in the abundance of all theſe things, they were thought unworthy to be received, and they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of God. For if a dead man, or one that is unworthy, doe come to the Sacraments, certainly they doe not give him life and worthineſſe, but he that is ſuch a one doth load himſelfe with a farre greater burthen of fault, and ſinne, ſeeing that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: the which thing the Apoſtle doth expreſly declare in the doctrine touching the Supper of the Lord, where he ſaith, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, this alſo muſt be knowne, that the veritie of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doth never faile them, ſo that they ſhould become not effectuall at any time: but in the inſtitution of Chriſt <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> they doe alwaies exerciſe their vertue and efficacie, in witneſſing, ſealing, confirming, unto the worthy receivers, preſent grace &amp; ſalvation, but unto the unworthy, their fault and condemnation, whether they be adminiſtred by a good and honeſt Prieſt, or by a cloſe ſinner.

Theſe Sacraments he added to the word of the Goſpel, that he might more lively ſet before our externall ſenſes, both thoſe things which he declareth unto us in his word, and thoſe alſo which he worketh inwardly in our hearts: and to confirme more and more in us that ſalvation, which he vouchſafeth to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unto us.

                  <p>There is but one Baptiſme in the Church of God: for it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to be once baptized or conſecrated unto God. For bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme once received doth continue all a mans life, and is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fealing of our adoption unto us. For to be baptized in the name of Chriſt, is to be enrolled, entered, and received into the covenant, and family, and ſo into the inheritance of the ſonnes of God, yea and in this life to be called after the name of God, that is to ſay, to be called the ſonne of God, to be purged alſo from the flchineſſe of ſinnes, and to be indued with the manifold grace of God, for to leade a new and innocent life. Baptiſme therefore doth call to minde, and keepe in remembrance the great benefit of God performed to mankinde: for we are all borne in the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſinne, and are the ſonnes of wrath. But God, who is rich in mercy, doth freely purge us from our ſinnes, by the bloud of his Sonne, and in him doth adopt us to be his ſonnes, and by an holy covenant doth joyne us to himſelfe, and doth inrich us with divers gifts, that we might live a new life. All theſe things are ſealed up unto us in Baptiſme. For inwardly we are regenerated, purified, and renewed of God through the holy Spirit: and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly we receive the ſealing of moſt notable gifts, by the water, by which alſo, thoſe great benefits are repreſented, and, as it were, ſet before our eyes to be looked upon. And therefore are we baptized, that is, waſhed and ſprinckled with viſible water. For the water maketh cleane that which is filthy, refreſheth things that faile and faint, and cooleth the bodies. And the grace of God dealeth in like manner with the ſoule, and that inviſibly, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually.</p>
                  <p>Moreover by the Sacrament of Baptiſme God doth ſeparate us from all other Religions of people, and doth conſecrate us a peculiar people to himſelfe. We therefore by being baptized, doe confeſſe our faith, and are bound to give unto God obedience, mortification of the fleſh, and newneſſe of life, yea and we are billed ſouldiers for the holy warfare of Chriſt, that all our life long wee ſhould fight againſt the world, Satan, and our owne fleſh: Moreover, we are baptized into one body of the Church that we might well agree with all the members of the Church in the ſame religion and mutuall duties.</p>
                  <p>We beleeve that <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this confeſſion.</note> that of all other is the moſt perfect manner
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61072:162"/> of baptiſme, where in Chriſt was baptiſed, and which the reſt of the Apoſtles did uſe in baptiſme. Thoſe things therefore which by mans device were added afterwards, and uſed in the Church, <note n="*" place="margin">2.

Of which kind is exorciſme, and the uſe of lights, oyle; ſalt, ſpattle, and ſuch other things, as namely that baptiſme is twiſe every yeer conſecrated with divers ceremonies. For we beleeve that the baptiſme of the Church, which is but one, was ſanctified in Gods firſt inſtitution of it, and is conſecrated by the word, and is now of full force, by, and for the firſt bleſſing of God upon it.</p>
                  <p>Wee teach that Baptiſme ſhould not be miniſtred in the Church by women or midwives. For <hi>Paul</hi> ſecludeth women from Eccleſiaſticall callings: but Baptiſme belongeth to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall offices. We condemne the Anabaptiſts, who deny that young infants, borne of faithfull parents, are to be baptized. For according to the doctrine of the Goſpel <hi>theirs is the kingdome of God.</hi> And they are written in the covenant of God. And why then ſhould not the ſigne of the covenant be given to them? Why ſhould they not be conſecrated by holy baptiſme, who are Gods peculiar people, and in the Church of God? We condemne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Anabaptiſts in the reſt of their opinions, which they pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly doe hold againſt the word of God. We therefore are not Anabaptiſts, neither doe we agree with them in any point that is theirs.</p>

                  <p>BAptiſme is a Sacrament, wherein the Lord by a viſible ſigne doth teſtifie his grace unto us, whereby he doth regenerate us, and cleanſe us from our ſinnes, and alſo receive us to be his people, that we may live to Chriſt, die to the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and be partakers of the good things of Chriſt. For we all are borne ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereupon we have need of regeneration, and the purging of our ſinnes, which cometh to paſſe by the free mercy of God, whereby alſo we are received into the covenant, that being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into his death, we may riſe againe in newneſſe of life, the which thing is taught more at large in the Apoſtls writings. But the goodneſſe of God doth in deed give unto us theſe heavenly gifts, and alſo uſeth a ſigne hereunto, that it may declare theſe things unto us, and by pouring them into our ſenſes, might allure us to more excellent things, that ſo the whole glory might be proper to God, and yet the holy inſtitution of the ſigne might not be made fruſtrate. For it is moſt truly ſaid, <hi>Baptiſme doth ſave us:</hi> but it is added of <hi>Peter, Not that which waſheth away the filth of the body.</hi> And the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>I indeed doe baptiſe you with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but he (that is, Chriſt) <hi>ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi> Whereunto the holy Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, did ſay, <hi>Our Baptiſme is to be conſidered, not with ſenſible eyes, but with the eyes of the minde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo Baptiſme is a badge: for it ſerveth to our confeſſion. For this we do plainly confeſſe in the Church, that we together with our children and all our family doe profeſſe the Chriſtian religion, that the members of that body whereof Chriſt is the Head, to whom we have given our names, are received of him into the number of thoſe ſouldiers, who by the good guiding of Chriſt do through all their life exerciſe a warfare againſt the world, Satan, and the fleſh.</p>

                  <p>TOuching holy Baptiſme it is taught, that men muſt beleeve and profeſſe, that this is a Sacrament or wholeſome mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the New Teſtament, inſtituted of Chriſt the Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the faithfull Miniſters have in charge that by the adminiſtration hereof, they benefit the holy Church. This Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſteth of an outward waſhing, that is done with water, with calling on the name of the holy Trinity (that of the element and word may ariſe and be joyntly withall made a Sacrament)<note place="margin">Auguſt. he. in Ioan. cap. 13.</note> and that waſhing is uſed both to ſignifie, and to witneſſe a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall waſhing, and inward cleanſing of the holy Ghoſt from the diſeaſe of hereditarie ſinne, and from other ſinnes, the guilt of which is here forgiven and taken away, and to the attaining of a new manner of birth, or regeneration: whereupon it is called the Sacrament of the new birth, that is, of regeneration, or a waſhing with water in the word of life. For we beleeve that whatſoever<note place="margin">Act. 2. and 22.</note> by Baptiſme, as by a Sacrament added to the word of the Goſpel, is in the outward ceremonie ſignified and witneſſed, all that doth the Lord God work and performe inwardly: that is, that he waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Iohn 3. Tit. 3. Epheſ. 5. Galat. 3. Rom. 6. 1 Pet. 3.</note> away ſinne, begetteth a man againe, and beſtoweth ſalvation upon him, and through the waſhing of water, cleanſeth by the word the ſocietie of his Church, cloatheth and apparelleth it with his Son, burieth and taketh away ſin, and giveth teſtimonie to, and ſealeth the peace of a good conſcience. For Baptiſme is not a waſhing away of the outward filth of the fleſh, but the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation or promiſe that a good conſcience maketh unto God. For the beſtowing of theſe excellent fruits was holy Baptiſme given and granted to the Church, which the faithfull ſhepheards of ſoules ought to adminiſter, and which the faithfull people of Chriſt, touching the receiving thereof, ought to uſe lawfully but once only: yet, in deed and truth, throughout their whole life.</p>
                  <p>And although Baptiſme in the Primitive Church was for the moſt part miniſtred to ſuch, as were well grown and of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after a confeſſion of faith made by them, according to Chriſts commandement: yet this is taught, that young children alſo, who
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61072:163"/> are reckoned in the number of Gods people, in like ſort are by this miniſterie to be benefited toward the attaining of ſalvation, that they likewiſe may be conſecrated and dedicated to Chriſt, according to this commandement, when he ſaith, <hi>Suffer ye the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>little ones to come to me, and forbid them not: becauſe unto ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the kingdome of God.</hi> Therefore according to the word of the Lord, and many other teſtimonies and other promiſes made to this beloved age of children, eſpecially when as alſo there is extant an example of that ancient miniſterie ordained of God, to<note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> wit, Circumciſion, which by reaſon of the covenant belonged not onely to thoſe of diſcretion, but therewithall alſo to young children. For theſe cauſes doe our Miniſters without any doubt, and boldly, baptize children in the name of the holy Trinitie, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying unto them a ſigne of moſt effectual vertue, and a moſt ſure witnesbearing of that thing which by Chriſts owne words is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to this age, and is imparted unto it. For ſo Chriſt in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and without exception, giveth in charge, not touching ſome, but touching all, <hi>Teach ye all nations, and baptize them, in the name</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 28. Act. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And ſo over children this moſt holy name is called upon, in which alone there is ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>This is further alſo taught, that they who are once lawfully and truely baptized, when they come to yeeres, ought to do their endeavour, that they may learn to acknowledge and know what holy Baptiſme is, and therewithall the Catholike and Chriſtian faith (without which Baptiſme availeth nothing) to the end that afterward when they doe deſire to be partakers of the Lord his Supper, they may with their owne mouthes, and of their owne accord, make profeſſion of their faith, and may renew their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, by which they were conſecrated to the Lord. And ſuch, that is, which are thus inſtructed, our miniſters receive unto this covenant of holy baptiſme, and <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. Obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion.</note> by the laying on of hands do teſtifie to them, that grace is conteined in baptiſme to ſtrengthen them to the warfare of faith, and ſo after a convenient and godly manner, &amp; with uſe of pure ceremonies, and ſuch as are profitable to edifying, they bring them to the ſacrament of the L. Supper, without any reiteration of baptiſme, as there are evident tokens and examples to be ſeen of this matter in the Primitive Church, which is the true and beſt maiſtreſſe of the poſteritie, and going before leadeth us the way.

                  <p>VVE beleeve and confeſſe, that Ieſus Chriſt, which is the end of the law, hath by his owne bloud ſheading made an end of all other propitiatorie ſacrifice for ſinnes. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that Circumciſion, which was done by blood, being aboliſhed, he hath inſtituted Baptiſme in the place thereof, whereby we are received into the Church of God, and ſeparated from all other nations, and all kinde of ſtrange religions, being conſecrated unto him alone, whoſe badge and cogniſance we weare. Finally, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme is a token unto us, that he will be our God for ever, who alſo is our gracious Father. Therefore the Lord hath commanded all his to be baptized with pure water, <hi>In the name of the Father, the Sonue, and the holy Ghoſt,</hi> To ſignifie that the blood of Chriſt doth internally, through the operation of the Spirit, performe and effect that in the ſoule, which water doth externally worke in the bodies. For as water being poured upon us, and appearing in the body of him that is baptized, moiſtning the ſame doth waſh away the filthines of the body, ſo the blood of Chriſt, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoule, doth cleanſe it from ſinne, and doth make us the ſonnes of God, which before were the children of wrath. Not that this materiall water doth theſe things, but the ſprinckling of the precious blood of the Son of God, which is unto us as the red ſea, wherethrough we muſt paſſe, that we may depart from the tyranny of <hi>Pharaih,</hi> that is, the Devill, and enter into the ſpirituall land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Therefore the miniſters verily doe deliver unto us the Sacraments, and the viſible thing, but it is the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that giveth it unto us, that is repreſented by the Sacrament, namely, the gifts and inviſible graces, waſhing, purifying, and cleanſing our ſoules from all ſpots and iniquities, renuing in like manner, and filling our hearts with all comfort, and to conclude, giving unto us a certain perſwaſion of his Fatherly goodneſſe, cloathing us with the new man, and putting off the old man, with all his deeds. For theſe cauſes we do beleeve, that every one that deſireth to obtaine eternall life, ought to be baptized with one baptiſme, and that once alone, which never afterwards is to be itcrated, ſeeing that we cannot be borne twiſe.</p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:61072:165"/>
                  <p>Neither doth this Baptiſme profit us onely at that moment, when the water reſteth upon us, and when we are ſprinckled with it, but it is available throughout the whole time of our life. Therefore here we doe deteſt the errour of the Anabaptiſts, who are not onely content with one onely Baptiſme, and that once received, but doe alſo condemne the Baptiſme of infants, yea of thoſe that be borne of faithfull parents: but we by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doe beleeve that they ought to be baptized and ſealed with the ſigne of the covenant, for the which in times paſt the infants amongſt the Iſraelites were circumciſed, that is, by reaſon of the ſame promiſes made unto our infants, that were made unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                     </head>
                     <p>VVE acknowledge that Baptiſme is to be miniſtred, as well to infants, as to thoſe that are growne to full age, and that it is to be uſed in the Church, even to the end of this world, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt, according to Chriſt his inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Alſo we beleeve and confeſſe, that Baptiſme is that Sea, <hi>into the bottome whereof,</hi> as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>God doth caſt all our ſins,</hi> and forgive them for Chriſt his Sons ſake, through faith. But whereas ſome affirme, that ſinne remaining in man after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, is not indeed ſinne of it owne nature, we thinke it to be a more pernitious errour, then the common ſort of men doth judge it to be: For, although we doe not doubt, but that ſinne which remaineth after baptiſme, is forgiven to the faithfull for Chriſt, and by the free mercie of God, is not imputed any longer before the tribunall ſeat of God; yet if a man weigh and conſider the nature thereof, it is in deed in it ſelfe ſinne, <hi>by reaſon whereof,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid before, <hi>No man living is juſtified in the ſight of God; and, there is not a iuſt man in the earth, which doth good, and ſinneth not.</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>I ſee another law in my members, rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of my minde, and leading me captive unto the law of ſinne, which is in my members.</hi> Here <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of ſin, which remaineth after baptiſme, and he affirmeth, that it doth rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of his minde, that is, againſt the affection of the holy Ghoſt. Now, that which rebelleth againſt the holy Ghoſt, undoubtedly it is neceſſary, that it be very ſinne indeed. For this is the nature of ſinne, that it ſtrive againſt the holy Ghoſt. And, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. it is ſaid: <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61072:167"/> againſt the fleſh: and theſe are contrary the one to the other, ſo that ye cannot doe the ſame things that ye would.</hi> Here againe <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of ſinne remaining after Baptiſme: and doth manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attribute it to the nature of ſinne, to wit, to luſt againſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to be contrary to the Spirit, and to hinder, that righteouſneſſe may not be perfect in man. Therefore ſinne remaining after ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, of it nature is indeed ſinne, although it be not imputed to him that beleeveth, but is forgiven for Chriſt. And therefore <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Nupt. &amp; Concap. ad Valer. Lib. 1. Cap.</hi> 25. ſaith, <hi>It is anſwered, that the concupiſcence of the fleſh is forgiven in Baptiſme, not that there ſhould be no concupiſcence, but that it ſhould not be imputed to ſinne. For although the guilt be already diſcharged, yet the ſinne remaineth, till all our infirmities be healed, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>De Baptiſ. parnulorum, &amp; de Conſ. Diſt. 4. Cap. Per Baptiſmum: Through Baptiſme it is brought to paſſe, that the fleſh of ſinne be made voide, yet it is not ſo made voide, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered concupiſcence ſhould not remaine in the fleſh, but that it ſhould not hurt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover we teach, that he that is baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt, is ſprinckled with a ſpirituall anointing, that is, is made a member of Chriſt through faith, and endued with the holy Ghoſt, that the eares of his minde may be opened, and the eies of his heart lightened, to receive and underſtand heavenly things. And it is evident, that the uſe of the outward anointing was lawfull in that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Moſes</hi> inſtituted, and that outward anointing was uſed alſo in the Church, after that the Goſpel was publiſhed. But it is alſo evident, that in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there was a time for ſhadowes, but now, Chriſt being revealed, It is the time of truth, and the uſe of externall anointing pertaineth to the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world. Concerning the abrogating of theſe rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Col. 2.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61072:167"/> or with what profit, we may take examples of the Heathen, how to worſhip God, and to adminiſter his Sacraments, that ſaying of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 12. doth witneſſe, <hi>Take heed that thou doe not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the heathen, and enquire after their ceremonies, ſaying, As theſe nations worſhipped their Gods, ſo will I doe likewiſe, Ye ſhall not ſo doe unto the Lord your God.</hi> And that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 15. In vaine doe they worſhip me, teaching for doctrine, the precepts of men.</hi> And it is not to be doubted, that the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereof one part is the uſe of externall anointing, doe pertaine to the rudiments of this world, to whoſe decrees <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we are not tied: and whereof he ſaith in another place, <hi>Seeing that ye know God, yea, rather are knowne of God, how turne ye againe unto impotent and beggerly rudiments, whereunto as from the beginning, ye will be in bondage againe?</hi> Furthermore, how can it truely be affirmed, as <hi>Fabianus</hi> writeth, that the making or ceremonie of the outward anointing, ſhould be taught of the Apoſtles, ſeeing that the Acts of Councels doe witneſſe, that this Ceremonie was inſtituted of <hi>Sylveſter?</hi> And the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Hiſtorie doth ſhew, that the Apoſtles had no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make lawes concerning holy dayes, but to teach men true godlineſſe, and an upright converſation: how much leſſe did they purpoſe, to inſtitute externall anointings in the Church, and to bring in ſhadowes, where the Sunne doth ſhine moſt clearely.</p>
                     <p>There were added unto Baptiſme certaine other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies alſo, of ſalt, durt, apparell: but becauſe theſe are not thought neceſſary, no not of themſelves, amongſt whom they are uſed, and are in ſome ſort an idle imitation of thoſe ceremonies, which Chriſt ſometime uſed in doing miracles, there is no cauſe why we ſhould take any care for them, whileſt we are converſant in ſo many neceſſarie things.</p>

                     <p>VVE doe not doubt, but that the Apoſtles in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the Goſpel was revealed, and confirmed in the day of Penticoſt, did by the laying on of hands, give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beleevers in Chriſt that wonderfull gift of the holy Ghoſt, to wit, that they might ſpeake with tongues.

                        <hi>cannot be done of the leſſer: ſo is it to be worſhipped, and embraced with greater reverence.</hi> For to the Apoſtles it was commanded of God, that by the laying on of hands, they ſhould give, to thoſe that beleeve in Chriſt, the gifts of the holy Ghoſt.

Therefore after that the authority of the Goſpell was ſufficiently confirmed by ſuch miracles, as that wonderfull gift of tongues did ceaſe, ſo alſo the ceremonie of laying on of hands, whereby that gift was given, didaltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as touching this thing ceaſe.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Supper of the Lord (which is alſo called the Lords Table, and the Euchariſt, that is, a thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving) is therefore commonly called a ſupper, becauſe it was inſtituted of Chriſt in that his laſt Supper, and doth as yet repreſent the ſame, and in it the faithfull are ſpiritually fed and nouriſhed: For the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Supper of the Lord, is not an Angel or man, but the very Sonne of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who did firſt of all conſecrate it to his Church. And the ſame bleſſing and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ſtill remaine amongſt all thoſe who celebrate no other ſupper, but onely that, which the Lord did inſtitute, and at that doe recite the words of the Supper of the Lord, and in all things looke unto Chriſt onely by a true faith, at whoſe hands as it were they doe receive that which they doe receive, by the miniſterie of the miniſters of the Church. The Lord by this ſacred rite would have that great benefit to be kept in freſh remembrance, which he did for mankinde, to wit, that by giving up his body to death, and ſhedding his blood, he hath forgiven us all our ſinnes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from eternall death and the power of the Devil, and doth now feed us with his fleſh, and giveth us his blood to drink, which things being apprehended ſpiritually by a true faith, doe nouriſh us up to life everlaſting. And this ſo great a benefit is
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61072:169"/> renued, ſo oft as the Supper is celebrated. For the Lord ſaid, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this holy Supper alſo it is ſealed up unto us, that the very body of Chriſt was truely given up for us, and his blood was ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, leſt that our faith might ſomewhat waver. And this is outwardly repreſented unto us, by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, in the Sacrament, after a viſible manner, and as it were laid before our eyes to be ſeene, which is inwardly in the fonte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly performed by the holy Ghoſt. Outwardly bread is offered by the miniſter, and the words of the Lord are heard, <hi>Receive, eate, this is my body, take it, and devide it amongſt you: drinke ye all of this, this is my bloud.</hi> Therefore the faithful do receive that which is given by the miniſter of the Lord, and doe eate the bread of the Lord, &amp; drink of the Lords cup. But yet by the working of Chriſt through the holy Ghoſt, they receive alſo the fleſh and bloud of the Lord, and do feed on them to life everlaſting. For the fleſh and blood of Chriſt is true meate and drink unto everlaſting life, yea Chriſt himſelfe, in that he was delivered for us, and is our Saviour, is that ſpeciall thing and ſubſtance of the Supper, and therefore we ſuffer no thing to be put in his place.</p>
                  <p>But that it may the better and more plainly be vnderſtood, how the fleſh and blood of Chriſt are the meate and drinke of the faithfull, and are received by the faithfull to life everlaſting, we will adde moreover theſe foure things. Eating is of divers ſorts: for there is a corporall eating, whereby meat is taken into a mans mouth chewed with the teeth, and is ſwallowed downe into the belly. After this manner did the <hi>Capernaites</hi> in times paſt think, that they ſhould eat the fleſh of the Lord, but they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by him, <hi>John</hi> 6. For as the fleſh of Chriſt cannot be eaten bodily without great wickedneſſe and crueltie, ſo is it not meate for the belly, as all men doe confeſſe. We therefore diſallow that Canon in the Popes decrees, <hi>Ego Berengarius, de conſecrat. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</hi> 2. For neither did godly antiquitie beleeve, neither yet doe we beleeve, that the body of Chriſt can be eaten corporally, and eſſentially, with a bodily mouth.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a ſpirituall eating of Chriſts body, not ſuch a one, whereby it may be thought, that the very meate is changed into the ſpirit, but wherby (the Lords body &amp; blood remaining in their owne eſſence and proprietie) thoſe things are ſpiritually commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto us, not after a corporall, but after a ſpirituall manner
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61072:170"/> through the holy Ghoſt, who doth apply and beſtow upon us thoſe things (to wit, remiſſion of ſinnes, deliverance, and life everlaſting, which are prepared for us by the fleſh and bloud of our Lord, which were given for us: ſo as Chriſt doth now live in us, and we live in him, and doth cauſe us to apprehend him by a true faith, to this end, that he may become unto us ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meat and drinke, that is to ſay, our life. For even as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall meat and drinke doe not onely refreſh and ſtrengthen our bodies, but alſo doe keep them in life, even ſo the fleſh of Chriſt delivered, and his bloud ſhed for us, doe not onely refreſh and ſtrengthen our ſoules, but alſo doe preſerve them alive, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be corporally eaten and drunken, but for that they are<note place="margin">* Looke the 1. obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. upon this confeſſion.</note> communicated unto us ſpiritually by the Spirit of God, the Lord ſaying, <hi>The bread which I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of this world:</hi> alſo, <hi>my fleſh</hi> (to wit, corporally eaten) <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing, it is the Spirit which giveth life.</hi> And, <hi>the words which I ſpeake to you, are ſpirit and life.</hi> And as we muſt by eating receive the meat into our bodies, to the end that it may worke in us, and ſhew his force in our bodies, becauſe while it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, it profiteth us not at all; even ſo it is neceſſarie, that we receive Chriſt by faith, that he may be made ours, and that hee may live in us, and we in him. For he ſaith, <hi>I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me ſhall not hunger, and he that beleeveth in me, ſhall not thirſt any more.</hi> And alſo, <hi>He that eateth me, ſhall live through me, and he abideth in me, and I in him.</hi> By all which it appeareth manifeſtly, that by ſpirituall meat we meane not, an Imaginarie, but the very body of our Lord Ieſus, given to us, which yet is received of the faithfull, not corporally, but ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by faith: in which point we doe wholly follow the doctrine of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, in the ſixth of <hi>John.</hi> And this eating of the fleſh, and drinking of the bloud of the Lord, is ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, that without it no man can be ſaved. This ſpirituall eating and drinking is alſo without the Supper of the Lord, even ſo often as, and whereſoever a man doth beleeve in Chriſt. To which purpoſe that ſentence of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth happily belong. <hi>Why doſt thou prepare thy teeth and belly? Beleeve, and thou haſt eaten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides that former ſpirituall eating, there is a ſacramentall eating of the body of the Lord, whereby the faithfull man is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, not onely ſpiritually and internally, of the true body and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61072:170"/> blood of the Lord, but alſo outwardly, by comming to the table of the Lord, doth receive the viſible Sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord. True it is, that a faithfull man by beleeving did before receive the food that giveth life, and ſtill receiveth the ſame, but yet when he receiveth the Sacrament, he receiveth ſomething more. For he goeth on in continuall communication of the body and blood of the Lord, and his faith is daily more and more kindled, more ſtrengthened, and refreſhed, by the ſpirituall nouriſhment. For while we live, faith hath continuall encreaſings: and he that outwardly doth receive the Sacraments with a true faith, the ſame doth receive not the ſigne onely, but alſo doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy (as we have ſaid) the thing it ſelfe. Moreover, the ſame man doth obey the Lords inſtitution and commandement, and with a joyfull minde giveth thanks for his and the redemption of all mankinde, and maketh a faithfull remembrance of the Lords death, and doth witneſſe the ſame before the Church, of which body he is a member. This alſo is ſealed up to thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacraments, that the body of the Lord was given and his blood ſhed, not onely for men in generall, but particularly for every faithfull communicant, whoſe meat and drinke he is to life everlaſting. But as for him that without faith commeth to this holy table of the Lord, he is made partaker of the Sacrament on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the matter of the Sacrament, from whence commeth life and ſalvation, he receiveth not at all: And ſuch men doe unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily eate of the Lords table. <hi>Now they which doe unworthily eate of the Lords bread and drinke of the Lords cup, they are guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord, and they eate and drinke it to their Iudgement.</hi> For when as they doe not approach with true faith, they reproach and deſpite the death of Chriſt, and therefore eate and drinke condemnation to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>We doe not then ſo joyne the body of the Lord and his blood with the bread and wine, as though we thought, that the bread is the body of Chriſt, more then after a ſacramentall manner, or that the body of Chriſt doth lye hid corporally under the bread, ſo as it ought to be worſhipped under the formes of bread, or yet that he which receiveth the ſigne, receiveth the thing it ſelfe. The body of Chriſt is in the heavens, at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore our hearts are to be lifted upon high, and not to be fixed on the bread, neither is the Lord to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the bread, though notwithſtanding the Lord is not abſent
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61072:171"/> from his Church, when as they celebrate the Supper. The Sun being abſent from us in the heavens, is yet notwithſtanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent amongſt us effectually. How much more Chriſt the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, though in body he be abſent from us in the heavens, yet is preſent amongſt us, not corporally, but ſpiritually, by his lively operation, and ſo, he himſelfe hath promiſed in his laſt Supper to be preſent amongſt us. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 15. and 16. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth, that we have not the Supper without Chriſt, and yet have an unbloody and myſticall Supper, even as all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie called it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, we are admoniſhed, in the celebration of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, to be mindefull of the body whereof we are made members, and that therefore we be at concord with all our brethren, that we may live holily, and not pollute our ſelves with wickedneſſe, and ſtrange religions, but perſevering in the true faith to the end of our life, give diligence to excell in holineſſe of life. It is therefore very requiſite, that purpoſing to come to the Supper of the Lord, we doe trie our ſelves, according to the commandement of the Apoſtle, firſt with what faith we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, whether we beleeve that Chriſt is come to ſave ſinners, and to call them to repentance, and whether each man beleeve that he is in the number of them, that being delivered by Chriſt, are ſaved, and whether he have purpoſed to change his wicked life, to live holily, and perſevere through Gods aſſiſtance in true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in concord with his brethren, and to give worthy thanks to God for his delivery, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We thinke that rite, manner, or forme of the Supper to be the moſt ſimple and excellent, which commeth neereſt to the firſt inſtitution of the Lord, and to the Apoſtles doctrine. Which doth conſiſt, in declaring the word of God, in godly prayers, the action it ſelfe that the Lord uſed, and the repeating of it, the eating of the Lords body and drinking of his blood, the wholeſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Lords death, and faithfull giving of thanks, and in an holy fellowſhip in the union of the body of the Church. We therefore diſallow them, which have taken from the faithfull one part of the Sacrament, to wit, the Lords cup. For theſe doe very grievouſly offend againſt the inſtitution of the Lord, who ſaith, <hi>drinke you all of this,</hi> which he did not ſo plainly ſay of the bread. What manner of Maſſe it was, that the Fathers uſed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were tollerable, or intollerable, we doe not now diſpute.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61072:171"/> But this we ſay freely, that the Maſſe (which is now uſed throughout the Romiſh Church) for many and moſt juſt cauſes, is quite aboliſhed out of our Churches, which particularly we will not now recite for brevities ſake. Truly we could not like of it, becauſe that of a moſt wholeſome action, they have made a vaine ſpectacle, alſo becauſe it is made a meritorious matter, and is ſaid for money: likewiſe becauſe that in it the Prieſt is ſaid to make the very body of the Lord, and to offer the ſame really, even for the remiſſion of the ſins, of the quicke and the dead. Adde this alſo, that they doe it for the honour, worſhip, and reverence of the Saints in heaven, &amp;c.</p>

We doe therefore uſe this holy meat oftentimes, becauſe that being admoniſhed hereby, we doe with the eyes of faith behold the death and blood of Chriſt crucified, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon our ſalvation, not without a taſte of heavenly life, and a true ſenſe of life eternall, we are refreſhed, with this ſpirituall, lively, &amp; inward food, with an unſpeakable ſweetnes: and we do rejoyce with a joy that cannot be expreſſed in words, for that life which we have found, and we do wholly, &amp; with all our ſtrength, powre out thankeſgiving for ſo wonderfull a benefit of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us.

                     <p>THE Supper of the Lord is a Sacrament, to wit, the holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Lord, whereby he doth renue and witneſſe unto us his bountifulneſſe, to wit, the communion of his body and blood, and that by a viſible ſigne. For by bread and wine he doth declare unto us what he giveth, namely himſelfe, to be the nouriſhment of our life: for he by his body and blood doth feed us to life eternall. Therefore the very gift of God (that is, the body and blood of the Lord, to wit, the body of the Lord delivered unto death for us, and his blood ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinnes) is the chiefeſt part of this Sacrament. For the body and blood of Chriſt is thus made or prepared to be the lively meat of our ſoules. The Son of God doth die in the fleſh for us, that he might quicken us, he poureth out his blood, that he might cleanſe us from our ſins. To conclude, he raiſeth up his body from the dead, that our bodies may receive hope, and ſtrength to riſe againe. Thus therefore doth the Lord offer himſelfe to be eaten and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of us, and not a certaine falſe imagination of a man, or an idle picture, in his ſtead. For, beſide him there is nothing in heaven, or in earth, that may feed and ſatiate our ſoules. Now we doe indeed eate the bodie, and we doe indeed drinke the blood of our Lord, but not ſo rawly, as the Papiſts have hitherto taught, to wit, the bread being changed into naturall fleſh, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially (that is, corporally, or carnally) or the body being inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the bread, but ſpiritually, that is after a ſpirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with a faithfull minde. The Lord is eaten indeed, and with fruit, by faith, that now he may live whole in his, and his in him.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, theſe holy gifts of God (which are not given of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61072:172"/> any other, then of the Lord himſelfe) according to the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord, are repreſented unto us by viſible ſignes, to wit, bread and wine, and offered to our ſenſes, not that we ſhould reſt in them, but that our weakneſſe may be helped, and we may lift up our hearts unto the Lord, knowing that here we muſt thinke upon greater things, to wit, not of eating bread, or drinking wine, but of receiving the Lord himſelfe, with all his gifts, by a faithfull minde. Therefore when the gueſts ſee the bread on the board, they ſet their mindes upon the body of Chriſt, when they ſee the cup, they ſet their mindes upon the blood of Chriſt: when they ſee the bread broken, and the wine poured out, they conſider how that the body of Chriſt was tormented, and his blood poured out for their ſakes: as by bread the bodies are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and ſtrengthened, as by wine the mindes are made mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo the godly doe beleeve, that by the body of the Lord, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto death for them, they are fed to everlaſting life: alſo, that by his blood poured out upon the croſſe, their conſciences are renewed: to conclude, they doe feele the quickning power of Chriſt, which doth confirme them. In this ſort is the Supper of the Lord accompliſhed ſpiritually, thus are the bread and wine a Sacrament unto us, and not bare and naked ſignes. Hereupon now ariſeth a very great rejoycing, and thankſgiving, for ſo great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; alſo a praiſing, and confeſſing of the name of God: here thoſe works, which the Lord once finiſhed, are renued, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented: but eſpecially the death of the Lord is repeated, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it once hapned, and now is paſt, yet unto the faithfull it is as yet freſh and preſent. For the remembrance of the death of Chriſt, which we make in the Supper, is farre more noble and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then theirs, who in ſome prophane banquet are mindfull of their companion, when they drinke the wine that he gave them. For among theſe, he that is abſent worketh nothing: but in this holy Supper of the faithfull the Lord is preſent, and doth worke effectually by the ſpirit in the hearts of them, as he, who, according to his promiſes, is in the middeſt of them.</p>
                     <p>By theſe things it is moſt evident, that in the holy Supper, we doe not take away our Lord Chriſt from his Church, not deny that his body and blood is there received to be our nouriſhment unto life eternall: but we together with our predeceſſours, and the chiefe Prelates of our Religion, did, and as yet to this day, doe deny, that the very body of Chriſt is eaten carnally, or that it is
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61072:173"/> preſent every where corporally, and after a naturall manner. For we doe openly confeſſe, according to the Scriptures, and with all the holy Fathers, that Ieſus Chriſt our Lord left this world, and went to his Father: and that he now ſitteth at the right hand of his Father in heavenly glory, from whence he ſhall never deſcend, or be drawne downe into this earthly and tranſitory world. For the true preſence of Chriſt in the Supper, is heavenly, not earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or carnall. Alſo we denie that the bread is turned into the body of Chriſt miraculouſly, ſo that the bread ſhould become the very body of Chriſt naturally, and ſubſtantially, yet after a ſpirituall manner. To conclude, we denie that the body of Chriſt is united with the ſignes, by any other then a myſticall meane, whereof we have ſpoken ſufficiently in the generall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sacrament. Seeing therefore we have expreſſely ſaid and written with the holy Fathers, <hi>Tertullian, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And yet we do not therefore ſpeake theſe things, as though we did ſimply deny all kinde of the preſence of Chriſt in the Supper: for that kinde of preſence which now we have confeſſed, doth remaine true, without any prejudice to theſe kinde of ſpeeches. Moreover, the word <hi>This,</hi> in this ſentence, <hi>This is my body,</hi> doth not onely ſhew bread unto our corporall eyes, but therewith alſo it ſhe weth the very body of Chriſt unto the eyes of our minde.</p>
                     <p>Alſo we confeſſe, that this uſe of the Supper is ſo holy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, that whoſoever ſhall worthily, that is, with a true faith, eate of this bread, and drinke of this Cup of the Lord, he doth receive heavenly gifts from the Lord: but <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup; unworthily,</hi> that is, without faith, (by which alone we are made partakers of the Lord, and of ſalvation) <hi>He doth eate and drinke iudgement unto himſelfe,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the Corinthians. Wherefore we doe often put this diligently into the heads of our people, that they take heed, that none of them abuſe the Lords table, but <hi>that every one exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelfe, and then eate of that bread, and drinke of that cup.</hi> Alſo, the Lords Supper is a badge unto us; for as one loafe, and one wine, are made of many graines and grapes, ſo we, being the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:61072:173"/> whole multitude of the faithfull, are gathered together to be one bread, and one body. By this we teſtifie in an outward profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we are redeemed by the blood of Chriſt, and made the members of Chriſt, to whom we give thanks, in whom we are confederates, and doe promiſe to performe mutuall duties one toward another.</p>

                  <p>IN the thirteenth place we teach, touching the Supper of the Lord inſtituted in the new Teſtament, that we muſt beleeve with the heart, and profeſſe with the mouth, that it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inſtituted of Chriſt our Lord, in his laſt Supper, and that in expreſſe forme of words; that is, that concerning bread and wine, he hath pronounced, that they be his body, and his blood, and that<note place="margin">Matth. 26. Mark. 14. Luke 22.</note> they were delivered to his Apoſtles, and ſo in like ſort to the whole univerſall Church, for a monument of his death, and that all men ſhould lawfully uſe the participation thereof, even to the end of the world. Of this Sacrament the Evangeliſts doe write, and eſpecially Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe words even to this day are thus read in the Church: <hi>I have received of the Lord, that</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>which I alſo have delivered unto you, to wit, that the Lord Ieſus, in that night, wherein he was betraied, tooke bread, &amp;c.</hi> And a little after, <hi>When ye come together</hi> (to wit, to the Supper of the Lord) <hi>Let one tarry for another.</hi> Therefore according to theſe things, we beleeve with the heart, and confeſſe with the mouth, that this bread of the Lords Supper is the body of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, delivered for us: and that this Cup, or the wine in the Cup, is likewiſe ſhed for us for the remiſſion of ſine. And this we affirme according to the expreſſe words of Chriſt, wherein he ſaith, <hi>This is my body, This is my blood.</hi> Which words may not be taken or underſtood of any other thing, nor be otherwiſe referred, then only to the bread, and cup of the Lord: and the body and blood of the Lord cannot be underſtood of any other, then of the onely true and proper body of Chriſt (which he made meat by his torments) and of his blood, which being largely pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of his body, he appointed to be drinke for his Church: for he had not a naturall body, and another blood. Therefore
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61072:174"/> our Miniſters doe teach, that to theſe certaine words pronounced by Chriſt our Lord, (wherein he doth peculiarly pronounce, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and inſtitute bread to be his body, and wine to be his blood) I ſay, to theſe words no man may adde any thing, no man may detract any thing from them: but every man in theſe words is to beleeve <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. upon this confeſſion.</note> that, which of themſelves they ſignifie, and that no man ought to turne from them, either to the right hand, or to the left.</p>
                  <p>Yet to expound the meaning of this faith, we doe further teach, that although the bread be the body of Chriſt, according to his inſtitution, and wine be his blood, yet neither of theſe doe leave it nature, or change or loſe it ſubſtance, but that the bread is, and doth remaine bread, and that the wine is, and doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine wine, as alſo the holy Scripture doth give this it owne name to either of them. Otherwiſe, if it ſhould ceaſe to be an<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Ioan. Tract. 80. &amp; Epiſt. 23. ad Bonifa.</note> element, it ſhould not be a Sacrament, ſeeing that a Sacrament is then made, when the word is added to the element. Neither could it ſignifie, or beare witneſſe, if it had nothing in ſtead of that thing, whereof it is a Sacrament, or if the thing ſignified ſhould have any other manner of preſence, then that which is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall. Wherefore this ſpeech, <hi>Bread is the body,</hi> and <hi>Wine is the blood of Chriſt,</hi> is a ſacramentall ſpeech, to wit, that theſe two diſtinct things, doe remaine the ſelfe ſame thing, which in their owne nature they be, and yet by reaſon of a Sacramentall union, or Sacramentally, they be that alſo, which they doe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and whereof they doe teſtifie, and yet not in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or after a naturall manner, but by the inſtitution, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or witneſſing of the authour, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth excellently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this, where he thus writeth, <hi>The cup which we bleſſe, is it not the communion of the bloud of Chriſt? the bread which we break,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, both the good, and the wicked doe uſe this Sacrament, and yet the true beleevers doe receive it to life, and thoſe which doe not beleeve, doe receive it to judgement and condemnation. And although either of them do receive this Sacrament, and <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2 Obſervat. upon this confeſſion.</note> the truth thereof ſacramentally and outwardly, yet the beleevers doe receive it ſpiritually, and ſo to their ſalvation: without which ſpirituall receiving, there is no worthy receiving in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall uſe. For by this meane we are ingrafted into Chriſt, and into his body, and by this meane is that true union, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61072:175"/> of Chriſt with his Church, made: and in like ſort by this meane is the communion of the holy Church, which is a certaine ſpirituall body, made amongſt and with themſelves, whereof the Apoſtle writeth, <hi>There is one bread, and we being many are one body, ſeeing we are all made partakers of one bread.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, we are further taught, that with this miniſterie, or Sacrament of the Lord, no other thing ought to be done, or taken in hand, then that one thing, which was ſhewed, ordained, and expreſly commanded of Chriſt himſelfe, as when he reached bread, ſeverally, and peculiarly, to his Diſciples, and in expreſſe words, ſaid, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body:</hi> and in like ſort, when he reached to them the cup ſeverally, and peculiarly, ſaying, <hi>Drinke ye all of this, This is my bloud:</hi> Thus therefore, according to this commandement, the body and bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt muſt be diſtributed onely, and be received in common of the faithfull, or beleeving Chriſtians: but it muſt not be ſacrificed, or ſet before them, or lifted up, or ſhewed forth, to this end, that there it may be worſhipped, or kept, or carried about. And both theſe muſt be received in ſeverall elements, the body peculiarly and ſeverally, and alſo his holy blood ſeverally, as either of them were of the Lord inſtituted, reached forth, and given in common to all his Diſciples, ſeverally. And this doctrine was uſed in the firſt holy Church, and this Sacrament was wholly diſtributed in both parts and ſo received. But he that beſide, or contrary to theſe commandements, and inſtitution of Chriſt, dare bring in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, or ſomewhat more, and uſe it with this Sacrament, or wantonly invent therein at his pleaſure, he doth manifeſtly, and malapertly againſt our Lord, who inſtituted this Sacrament, and committeth a thing cleane contrary to his holy Teſtament, and laſt will, which was declared in his owne words, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely.</p>
                  <p>Alſo this Sacrament ought to be received and adminiſtred, without adoration, and without that worſhip which is due to God alone: yet with a due kinde of religion, and reverence, and chiefly with that, which is the chiefeſt of all, namely with faith and examination of himſelf, which in this action is moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſt our Lord, and moſt profitable for men, which alſo S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> taught the firſt Church, and exhorted it hereunto, ſaying,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Let every man trie or examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate of that bread, and drinke of that cup. For he that eateth, and drinketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61072:175"/> doth eate and drinke his owne iudgement, or condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe he diſcerneth not the Lords body.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Prove your ſelves, whether ye are in the faith: examine your ſelves:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>know ye not your owne ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?

For although, he be now in heaven, and ſhall remaine there, till he come to judge the world; yet we beleeve, that by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and incomprehenſible vertue of his Spirit, he doth nouriſh, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> and quicken us with the ſubſtance of his body and blood being apprehended by faith.

Therefore we reject all thoſe phantaſticall heads, which doe refuſe theſe fignes and tokens, ſeeing that Chriſt our Lord hath ſaid, <hi>This is my body:</hi> and, <hi>This cup is my bloud.</hi>

                  <p>VVE beleeve and confeſſe, that Ieſus Chriſt our Lord<note place="margin">Artic. 35.</note> and Saviour hath inſtituted the holy Sacrament of his Supper, that in it he might nouriſh and ſuſtaine thoſe, whom he hath regenerated and engrafted into his family, which is the Church. But thoſe which are regenerate, have in them a double life, the one carnall and temporall, which they brought with them from their firſt nativitie, the which is common unto all: the other ſpirituall and heavenly, beſtowed upon them in their ſecond nativitie, which is wrought in them by the word of the Goſpel, in the union of the body of Chriſt, the which is peculiar to the elect alone. And as God hath appointed earthly and materiall bread, fit and convenient for the preſervation of this carnall life, which, even as the life it ſelfe, is common unto all: ſo for the conſervation of that ſpirituall and heavenly life, which is proper to the faithfull, God hath ſent lively bread, which came downe from heaven, even, Ieſus Chriſt, who nouriſheth and ſuſtaineth the ſpirituall life of the faithfull, if he be eaten, that is, applied and received by faith, through the Spirit. But to the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61072:178"/> intent that Chriſt might figurate and repreſent unto us this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and heavenly bread, he hath ordained viſible and earthly bread and wine for the Sacrament of his body and blood: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he teſtifieth, that as truly as we doe receive and hold in our hands this ſigne, eating the ſame with our mouthes, whereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards this our life is ſuſtained; ſo truly we doe by faith (which is in ſtead of our ſoule, hand, and mouth) receive the very body and true bloud of Chriſt our onely Saviour, in our ſelves, unto the conſervation and cheriſhing of a ſpirituall life within us. And it is moſt certaine, that Chriſt, not without good cauſe, doth ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully commend unto us this his Sacrament, as one that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed work that within us, whatſoever he repreſenteth unto us by theſe his holy ſignes: although the manner it ſelfe, beeing far above the reach of our capacitie, cannot be comprehended of any: becauſe that all <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. Obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion.</note> the operations of the holy Ghoſt are hidden and incomprehenſible. Neither ſhall we erre in ſaying, that, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> that which is eaten, is the very naturall body of Chriſt, and that which is drunke, is the very blood of Chriſt: yet the inſtrument or meanes, whereby we doe eate and drinke them, is not a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall mouth, but even our ſoule and ſpirit, and that by faith. Chriſt therefore ſitteth alwaies at the right hand of his Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet for all that doth not any thing the leſſe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelfe unto us by faith. Furthermore, this Supper is the ſpirituall table, wherein Chriſt doth offer himſelfe to us, with all his benefits, to be participated of us, and bringeth to paſſe, that in it we are partakers, as well of himſelf, as of the merit of his death and paſſion. For he himſelfe, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. upon this confeſſion.</note> by the eating of his fleſh, doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſtrengthen, and comfort, our miſerable, afflicted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe ſoule, and in like manner, by the drinking of his blood, doth refreſh and ſuſtaine the ſame. Moreover, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 4. Obſervat.</note> although the ſignes be coupled with the things ſignified, yet both of them are not received of all. For an evill man verily receiveth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto his owne condemnation, but the thing or truth of the Sacrament he receiveth not. As for example, <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> doth of them did receive the Sacramentall ſigne, but as for Chriſt himſelfe ſignified thereby, they received him not. For Chriſt is communicated to the faithfull only. Laſt of all, we with great humilitie and reverence doe communicate the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that aſſembly of Gods people celebrating the memoriall of our Saviour Chriſts death with thankeſgiving and making
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61072:179"/> there a publike confeſſion of Chriſtian faith and religion. No man therefore ought to preſent himſelfe at this holy Supper, which hath not firſt examined himſelfe, leſt that eating this bread, and drinking of this cup, he doe not eate and drinke his owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Moreover, by the uſe of this Sacrament, a moſt ardent love is kindled within us, both towards God himſelfe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo towards our neighbour.

                     <head>Hitherto alſo pertaineth the firſt Article, of the abuſes, which are changed in the outward rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. This Article is, of the Maſſe.</head>
                     <p>OVr Churches are wrongfully accuſed, to have aboliſhed the Maſſe. For the <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. Obſervat.</note> Maſſe is retained ſtill among us, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated with great reverence. Yea and almoſt all the ceremonies that are in uſe, ſaving that, with the ſongs in Latine we mingle
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61072:179"/> certaine <hi>Pſalmes</hi> in Dutch here and there, which be added for the peoples inſtruction. For therefore we have need of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that they may teach the unlearned, and that the preaching of Gods word may ſtirre up ſome unto the true feare, truſt, and invocation of God. This is not onely commanded by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to uſe a tongue that the people underſtand, but mans law hath alſo appointed it. We uſe the people to receive the Sacrament together, if ſo be any be found fit thereunto. And that is a thing that doth increaſe the reverence and due eſtimation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ceremonies. For none are admitted, except they be firſt proved, and tried. Beſides we uſe to put men in minde of the worthineſſe and uſe of a Sacrament, what great comfort it offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto them, which repent, to the end that men may learne to feare God, and beleeve in him, and to uſe prayer and ſupplication unto him, looking for all good things at his hands. This is the true worſhip of Chriſtians. Theſe ſervices, of feare, faith, prayer, hope, &amp;c. God doth like of. When therefore theſe ſervices are performed, and exerciſed in the uſe of Ceremonies, then doth the uſing of the Sacraments pleaſe God. So that when as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is uſed to the ceremonie, and advertiſed of the true uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Maſſes are ſaid with us after meet and godly manner. And thus all things are ordered in the Church with greater gravitie and reverence, then in times paſt. It is not unknown that theſe many ages paſt there hath been common &amp; open complaintmade by good men, of the abuſe and prophaning of Maſſes. For it is eaſie to be ſeene, how farre this abuſe hath ſpread it ſelfe in all temples and Churches, what kinde of men they are that ſay the Maſſes, flat contrary to the preſcript of the Canons. Alſo how ſhamefully they are turned to a matter of curſed lucre. For many there be that ſay Maſſes, without repentance, onely for the bellies ſake. Theſe things are too open and manifeſt to be kept any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in hugger mugger. Surely it ſeemeth that never any religious thing ſince the world began was ſo commonly turned into gain, as the Maſſe. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth fearfully threaten them, which deale otherwiſe with theſe Sacraments, then is beſeeming the dignitie of them, where he ſaith, <hi>He that eateth this bread and drinketh this cup unworthily, is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> And in the Ten Commandements, it is written, <hi>He that abuſeth Gods holy name, ſhall not eſcape unpuniſhed.</hi> As therefore the world hath of thereto fore been juſtly puniſhed for I dolatrie,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:61072:180"/> doubtleſſe this ſhameleſſe profaning of Maſſes will be fearefully revenged with grievous plagues. And it may well be that the Church in theſe latter times is puniſhed with blindneſſe, diſcord, and wars, and many other plagues, chiefly for this one cauſe. And yet theſe open and groſſe abuſes have the Biſhops (who cannot be ignorant of them) not onely borne with all, but alſo ſmoothly laughed at them. And now all, too late, they begin to complaine forſooth of the calamitie of the Church, when as no other thing hath been the occaſion of the broiles of theſe times, but the abuſes themſelves, which were now become too open and evident, that modeſt men could no longer bear them. I would to God that the Biſhops had (as by their office they might have) long before this bridled, and reſtrained the covetouſneſſe or impudencie, whether of Monks, or of ſome others, who changing the manner of the old Church, have made the Maſſe a monie matter.</p>
                     <p>But it ſhall not be amiſſe now to ſhew, whence theſe abuſes did ſpring at the firſt. There is an opinion ſpread abroad in the Church, that the Supper of the Lord is a worke, which being once done by the Prieſt, deſerveth remiſſion of ſins, both of the fault, and of the puniſhment, not onely for him that doth it, but alſo for thers: and that becauſe of the worke done, although it be done without any good intent of the doer. Likewife, that if it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the behalfe of the dead, it is ſatisfactorie, that is, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth remiſſion of the paines of purgatorie. And in this meaning they take the word <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> when they call the Maſſe a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, namely a worke, that being done in the behalfe of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, doth merit for them both remiſſion of the fault, and of the puniſhments, and that becauſe of the very work done, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any good intent of him that uſeth it. Thus they meane, that the Prieſt in the Maſſe doth offer a ſacrifice for the quick and the dead. And after this perſwaſion was once received, they taught men to ſeeke forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and all good things, yea and that the dead were freed from puniſhments, by the benefit of the Maſſe. And it made no matter, what kinde of men they were, that ſaid the Maſſes: for they taught that they were very available for others, without any good motion of the uſer. Afterward a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion aroſe, whether one Maſſe ſaid for many, was as available, as ſeverall Maſſes for ſeverall perſons. And this diſputation did augment the number of Maſſes, and the gaine that came in by them, out of meaſure. But wee diſpute not now of the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61072:180"/> gaine, we onely accuſe the impietie of them. For our Divines doe prove plainly, that this opinion, of the meriting and applying of the Maſſe, is both falſe and impious. This is the ſtate of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between us and them.</p>
                     <p>And it is no hard matter for the godly to judge of this point, if a man will but weigh the arguments that follow. Firſt, we have proved before, that men doe obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes freely by faith, that is, by ſure truſt to obtaine mercy for Chriſts ſake. It is then impoſſible for a man to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes for another mans worke, and that without any good motion, that is, without his owne faith. This reaſon doth very evidently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that monſtrous and impious opinion, touching the merit and application of the Maſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſts paſſion was an oblation and ſatisfaction not onely for originall ſinne, but alſo for all other ſinnes, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, We are ſanctified by the oblation of Chriſt once offered.</hi> Againe, <hi>By one oblation he hath made perfect for ever thoſe that are ſanctified.</hi> To conclude, a good part of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> is ſpent in confirming this point, that the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice of Chriſt did merit remiſſion of ſinnes, or reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for others. Therefore (ſaith he) <hi>The Leviticall ſacrifices were oft times offered in one manner, becauſe they could not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſinnes, But Christ by his ſacrifice hath at once ſatisfied for the ſinnes of all men.</hi> This honour of Chriſts ſacrifice muſt not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from him to the worke of a Prieſt. For he ſaith expreſly, that <hi>by one oblation the Saints are made perfect.</hi> Beſides, it is a wicked thing to place that truſt in the worke of a Prieſt, which ſhould onely leane and ſtay it ſelfe upon the oblation and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt the high Prieſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt in the inſtitution of the Lords Supper, doth not command the Prieſts to offer for others, either quicke or dead: upon what ground then or authoritie was this worſhip ordained in the Church, as an offering for ſins, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God? But that is yet more groſſe and far from all reaſon, that the Maſſe ſhould be applied to deliver the ſoules of ſuch as are dead. For the Maſſe was ordained for a remembrance, that is, that ſuch as received the Supper of the Lord, ſhould ſtirre up and confirme their faith, and comfort their diſtreſſed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, with the remembrance of Chriſts benefits. Neither is the Maſſe a ſatisfaction for the puniſhment, but it was inſtituted for
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61072:181"/> the remiſſion of the fault, to wit, not that it ſhould bee a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the fault, but that it might be a Sacrament, by the uſe whereof, we might be put in minde of the benefit of Chriſt, and the forgiveneſſe of the fault. Seeing therefore that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the Supper of the Lord for the deliverance of the dead, is received without warrant of Scripture, yea quite contrarie to Scripture, it is to be condemned, as a new and ungodly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, a <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. upon this confeſſion.</note> Ceremonie, in the new covenant, without faith meriteth nothing, neither for him that uſeth it, nor for others. For it is a dead work, according to the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>The true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and truth.</hi> The ſame doth the 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Heb.</hi> throughout prove. <hi>By faith Abel offered a better offering unto God.</hi> Alſo, <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Therefore the Maſſe doth not merit remiſſion of the fault, or of the puniſhment, even for the workes ſake performed. This reaſon doth evidently overthrow the merit, as they call it, which ariſeth of the very worke that is done.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the applying of the benefit of Chriſt is by a mans own faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Rom. 3. Whom God hath ſet forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood,</hi> and this applying is made freely: And therefore it is not made by another mans work, nor for another mans worke. For when we uſe the Sacrament, this application is made by our own work, and by our own faith, and not by another mans work. For ſurely if we could have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but by applying of of Maſſes, it ſhould be very uncertain, and our faith and truſt ſhould be transferred from Chriſt unto the work of a Prieſt, &amp; ſo is it come to paſſe, as all men ſee. Now faith placed in the work of a man is wholly condemned. Theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with ſundry other do witnes for us, that the opinion of the merit and applying of the Maſſe for the quick and the dead, was for good cauſes miſliked and reproved. Now if we would ſtand to conſider, how far this error is ſpread in the Church, how the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Maſſes increaſed, and how through this ſacrifice, forgivenes both of the fault, and of the puniſhment, is promiſed to the quick and the dead, it will appear that the Church is disfigured with ſhameful blots by this prophanation. There never fel out a waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier cauſe in the Church, O noble Emperour, or more worthy for good &amp; learned men to debate of; it is the duty of all the godly, with moſt fervent prayers to crave at Gods hand, that the Church
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61072:181"/> might be delivered from theſe foule enormities. All Kings and Biſhops muſt with all their might endevour, that this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be rightly laid forth, and the Church purged.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, the inſtitution of a Sacrament is contrary to that abuſe. For there is not a word ſet downe of any oblation for the ſinnes of the quick and the dead, but a commandement to receive the body and bloud of Chriſt: and, to doe it in the remembrance of the benefit of Chriſt. This remembrance doth ſignifie, not a bare repreſenting of the hiſtory, as it were in a ſhew, as they dreame that are the Patrons of merit, by reaſon of the work wrought, but it ſignifieth by faith to remember the promiſe and benefit, to comfort the conſcience, and to render thanks for ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. For the principall cauſe of the inſtitution was, that our faith might then be ſtirred up and exerciſed, when we doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this pledge of Gods grace. Beſides, the inſtitution ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there ſhould be a communication, that is, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church ſhould give unto others, the body and blood of the Lord. And this order was obſerved in the Primitive Church. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is witneſſe to the <hi>Corinths:</hi> when as he commandeth, <hi>That one ſhould ſtay for another,</hi> that there might be a common partaking of the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Now that the abuſes of the private Maſſe be diſcovered, for as much as they all for the moſt part were uſed for the application for the ſinnes of other men, and doe not agree with the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, therefore they are left off in our Churches, And there is one common Maſſe appointed, according to the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, wherein the Paſtors of the Churches <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 4. Obſervat. upon this confeſſion.</note> do conſecrate themſelves, and give unto others, the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt: and this kind of Maſſe is uſed every <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 5. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> holy day, and other daies alſo, if any be deſirous to uſe the Sacrament. Yet none are admitted to the communion, except they be firſt tried, and examined. We adjoyne moreover godly Sermons, according as Chriſt commanded, that there ſhould be Sermons, when this Ceremonie is uſed. And in ſuch Sermons, men are both taught diligently in other Articles and Precepts of the Goſpel, and alſo put in minde, for what uſe the Sacrament was inſtituted, to wit, not that this Ceremonie could merit for them remiſſion of ſinnes, by the worke done, but that the Sacrament is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and a pledge whereby Chriſt witneſſeth unto us, that he performeth his promiſes. And in our Sermons as men are taught
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:61072:182"/> diligently concerning other articles and precepts of the Goſpel, ſo are they alſo put in minde, for what uſe the Sacraments were inſtituted, to wit, not that the ceremonie ſhould merit remiſſion of ſins by the bare work wrought: but that the Sacrament ſhould be a teſtimonie and a pledge, whereby Chriſt doth teſtifie, that he performeth his promiſe, and that his promiſes pertaine unto us, that Chriſt giveth us his body, to teſtifie that he is effectuall in us, as in his members, and his blood, for a witneſſe unto us, that we are waſhed with his blood. The Sacrament therefore doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them, that do repent, and ſeeke comfort therein, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that teſtimonie, doe beleeve that remiſſion of ſinnes is given them indeed, and are thankfull unto Chriſt for ſo great a benefit. And ſo the application of the benefit of Chriſt is not by an other mans worke, but by every mans owne faith, and his own uſe of the Sacrament. For when we in our owne perſons uſe the Sacrament, Chriſts inſtitution of it doth belong unto us. This kinde of uſe of the Sacrament is holy, and to be taught in the Churches, which doth give light unto the doctrine of faith, and of the ſpirituall exerciſes, and true worſhip, and bringeth unto the conſciences of the godly very great comfort and ſtrength of faith. Before theſe dayes the Church hath been farre otherwiſe taught, touching the uſe of the Sacrament, there was no word of any thing, but that this worke was to be done. But no man ſpake any thing of faith, or the comfort of conſciences. And mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were racked with over great care and paines of confeſſing themſelves. This they tooke to be the puritie which the Goſpel requireth, whereas the Goſpel doth require true feare, true faith, and truſt, comforteth us by the uſe of this Sacrament, that they which doe truly repent may aſſuredly beleeve, that God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mercifull unto them by Chriſt, though that our nature be fraile and uncleane, and though that this our imperfect obedience be farre from the perfection of the Law.</p>
                     <p>By all this that hath beene ſaid, it is cleare that the Maſſe that is in uſe amongſt us, doth agree with the inſtitution of Chriſt, and the manner of the Primitive Church. And beſides it doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably lay open the true uſe of the Sacrament. Such a common worke was there in the Church of old time, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth witneſſe, who ſaith, <hi>that the Prieſt did ſtand at the Altar, and call ſome unto the communion, and put backe others.</hi> And by the decrees of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Synode it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>vident, that ſome one did celebrate the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61072:182"/> Liturgie, as the Grecians call it, and did miniſter the body and blood of the Lord to all the reſt. For theſe are the words of the Decree. <hi>Let the Deacons in their order after the Prieſts receive the holy communion of a Biſhop, or of a Prieſt.</hi> Here he doth expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that the Prieſts did receive the Sacrament of ſome one, that miniſtred it. And before <hi>Gregories</hi> time there is no mention of any private Maſſe. But as oft as the old Writers ſpeak of a Maſſe, it is evident that they ſpeake of a Maſſe, that was common. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore that the rite and manner of the Maſſe uſed with us hath authoritie out of Scripture, example from the old Church, and that we have onely rejected certaine intollerable abuſes, we hope that the uſe of our Churches cannot be miſliked. As for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indifferent rites and ceremonies, they are for the moſt part obſerved according to the uſuall manner. But the number of Maſſes is not alike. <hi>Neither was it the uſe in the old times, in the Churches whereunto was greateſt reſort, to have Maſſe every day,</hi> as the Tripartite hiſtorie. <hi>lib. 9. cap.</hi> 38. doth witneſſe. <hi>Againe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in Alexandria every fourth and ſixth day of the weeke the Scriptures are read, and the Doctors doe interpret them, and all other things are done alſo, except onely the ſolemne mannerof obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or offering.</hi>

                     <p>OVr Church is wrongfully accuſed, to have aboliſhed the Maſſe. For <note n="*" place="margin">Look the 2. Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the Maſſe is retained ſtill among us, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with great reverence. Yea and almoſt all the ceremonies that are in uſe, ſaving that, with the ſongs in Latine we mingle certaine Pſalmes in Dutch here and there, which be added for the peoples inſtruction. For therefore we have need of ceremonies, that they may teach the unlearned, and that the Preaching of Gods word may ſtirre up ſome unto the true feare, truſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of God. This is not only, commanded by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to uſe a tongue that the people underſtand, but mans law hath alſo appointed it. We uſe the people to receive the Sacrament toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if ſo be any be found fit thereunto. And that is a thing that doth increaſe the reverence and due eſtimation of the publike ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. For none are admitted, except they be firſt proved,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61072:183"/> and tried. Beſides we uſe to put men in minde of the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and uſe of a Sacrament, how great comfort it bringeth to fearefull conſciences, that they may learne to beleeve God, and to looke for and crave all good things at his hands. This worſhip doth pleaſe God, ſuch an uſe of the Sacrament doth nouriſh pietie towards God. Therefore it ſeemeth not that Maſſes be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly celebrated among our adverſaries, then with us. But it is evident, that of long time this hath been the publike, and moſt grievous complaint of all good men, that Maſſes are filthily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned, being uſed for gaine. And it is not unknown, how farre this abuſe hath ſpread it ſelfe in all Churches, of what manner of men Maſſes are uſed, onely for a reward, or for wages, and how many doe uſe them, againſt the prohibition of the Canons. And <hi>Paul</hi> doth grievouſly threaten thoſe, which handle the Lords Supper unworthily, ſaying, <hi>He that ſhall eate this bread, or drinke the cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> Therefore, when we admoniſhed the Prieſts of this ſinne, private Maſſes were laid aſide among us, ſeeing that for the moſt part, there were no private Maſſes, but onely for lucres ſake. Neither were the Biſhops ignorant of theſe abuſes, who if they had amended them in time, there had now been leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion. Heretofore, by their diſſembling, they ſuffered much corruption to creepe into the Church: now they begin, though it be late, to complaine of the calamities of the Church, ſeeing that this hurly burly was raiſed up by no other meane, then by thoſe abuſes, which were ſo evident, that they could no longer be tolerated. There were many diſſentions, concerning the Maſſe, and as touching the Sacrament. And peradventure the world is puniſhed, for ſo long a prophaning of Maſſes, which they, who both could, and ought to have amended it, have ſo many yeeres tolerated in their Churches. For in the ten commandements it is written, <hi>He that abuſeth the name of the Lord, ſhall not eſcape unpuniſhed.</hi> And from the beginning of the world, there neither was, nor is any divine thing, which might ſeeme ſo to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gaine, as is the Maſſe.</p>
                     <p>There was added an opinion, which did increaſe private Maſſes infinitely, to wit, that Chriſt by his paſſion did ſatisfie for Originall ſin, and appointed Maſſe, wherein an oblation ſhould be made for daily ſins, both mortall, and veniall. Hereupon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion was received, that Maſſe is a work, that taketh away
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61072:183"/> the ſins of the quicke and the dead, and that for the doing of the worke. Here men began to diſpute, whether one Maſſe ſaid for many, were of as great force, as particular Maſſes ſaid for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men. This diſputation hath brought forth an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Maſſes. Concerning theſe opinions our preachers have admoniſhed us, that they doe diſagree from the holy Scriptures, and hurt the glory of the paſſion of Chriſt. For the paſſion of Chriſt was an oblation and ſatisfaction, not onely for Originall ſinne, but alſo for all other ſinnes, as it is written in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews: <hi>We are ſanctified by the oblation of Ieſus Chriſt once made.</hi> Alſo, <hi>By one oblation he hath made perfit for ever thoſe that are ſanctified.</hi> Alſo the Scripture teacheth, that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God through faith in Chriſt, when we beleeve that our ſins are forgiven for Chriſt his ſake. Now, if the Maſſe doe take away the ſins of the quicke and the dead, even for the works ſake that is done, then juſtification cometh by the work of Maſſes, and not by faith, which the Scripture can not away withall. But Chriſt commandeth us <hi>to do it in remembrance of himſelfe:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Maſſe is inſtituted, that faith, in them which uſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, may remember what benefits it receiveth by Chriſt, and that it may raiſe up, and comfort a fearefull conſcience. For this is to remember Chriſt, to wit, to remember his benefits, and to feele and perceive, that they be in deed exhibited unto us. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſufficient to call to minde the hiſtorie, becauſe that the Iewes alſo, and the wicked can doe that. Therefore the Maſſe muſt be uſed to this end, that there the Sacrament may be reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, that have need of comfort, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>Becauſe I doe alwaies ſinne, therefore I ought alwaies to receive a medicine.</hi> And ſeeing that the Maſſe is ſuch a communion of the Sacrament, we doe obſerve one common Maſſe every Holiday, and on other daies, if any will uſe the Sacrament, when it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them, which deſired it. Neither is this cuſtome newly brought into the Church. For the ancient Fathers before <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi> time make no mention of any private Maſſe: of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maſſe they ſpeake much. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Prieſt did daily ſtand at the Altar, and call ſome unto the Communion, and put backe others.</hi> And by the ancient Canons it is evident that ſome one did celebrate the Maſſe, of whom other Prieſts and Deacons did receive the body of the Lord. For ſo the words of the Nicen Canon do ſound: <hi>Let the Deacons in their order after

And therefore the people doth uſe the Sacrament, as Chriſt appointed it. And certainly Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth. 26.

And that no man might cavill, that it doth only appertaine to the Prieſts, the ordinance of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians doth witneſſe, that the whole Church did in common uſe either part. This cuſtome remained a long time even in the latter Churches, neither is it certaine, when, or by what author it was changed. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in certaine places doth witneſſe, that the blood, was given to the people: for thus he writeth to <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Pope: <hi>How doe we teach, or provoke them, to ſhed their blood, in the confeſsion of his name, if we denie the blood of Chriſt to them, which are in this warfare? or how ſhall we make them fit for the cup of Martyrdome, if we doe not firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, by the right of communidation, to drinke in the Church the cup of the Lord?</hi> And <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Prieſts doe miniſter
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61072:184"/> the Euchariſt, and devide the blood of the Lord to the people.</hi> In the Decrees there is a Canon of Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> which forbiddeth the Sacrament to be devided: theſe be the words: <hi>We doe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that certaine men, having received the portion of the holy body onely, doe abſtaine from the Cup of the holy blood: who, becauſe that I know not by what ſuperſtition they are taught to be tied here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, either let them unfeignedly receive the whole Sacraments, or let them be put backe from the whole Sacraments, becauſe that one, and the ſelfe ſame myſtery cannot be devided, without great ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> In the Tripartite Hiſtory it is written, in the reprehenſion of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour (whom <hi>Ambroſe</hi> would not admit to the communion, without repentance, becauſe that at Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia he had too grievouſly revenged the death of a few Souldiers which were ſlaine in an uproare, and had murthered ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Citizens) here, ſaith <hi>Ambroſe, How cauſt thou with theſe hands receive the holy body of the Lord? with what raſhneſſe canſt thou take into thy mouth the Cup of that holy blood? &amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is evident, that it was the cuſtome of the ancient Church, to give either part of the Sacrament, to the people: onely a new ſtart up cuſtome doth take away one part from the people. Here we will not diſpute, what men are to thinke, concerning a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved cuſtome, contrary to the authoritie of the Apoſtolike Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, contrary to the Canons, and contrary to the example of the Primitive Church. For all godly men doe underſtand, that, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian doctrine, conſciences are to aske counſell at the word of the Lord, and that no cuſtome is to be allowed, which is contrary to the word of God. And although in the Latine Church cuſtome hath changed the ancient manner, yet it doth not diſallow, or forbid it: neither in deed ought humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to forbid the ordinance of Chriſt and the moſt received cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the ancient Church. Therefore we have not thought it good, to forbid the uſe of the whole Sacrament: and in that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, which ought to be the covenant of mutuall love in the Church, we would not, contrary to charitie, be hard to other mens conſciences, which had rather uſe the whole Sacrament, neither did we thinke, that any crueltie ſhould be uſed in that matter: but ſo much as in us lyeth, together with the ceremony, we have reſtored the holy doctrine touching the fruit of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, that the people may underſtand, how the Sacrament is laid before them, to comfort the conſciences of them that doe repent.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61072:185"/> This doctrine doth allure the godly to the uſe and reverence of the Sacrament. For not onely the ceremonie, was before mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but alſo the chiefe doctrine, touching the fruit thereof, was utterly neglected. And peradventure the maiming of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie did ſignifie, that the Goſpel touching the blood of Chriſt (that is, the benefit of Chriſt his death) was obſcured. Now, by the benefit of God, the pure Doctrine concerning faith, together with this ceremonie, is renued, and reſtored.</p>

                     <p>BOth Baptiſme and the Supper of the Lord are pledges, and teſtimonies of grace, as was ſaid before, which doe admoniſh us of the promiſe, and of our whole redemption, and doe ſhew, that the benefits of the Goſpel do pertaine to every one of thoſe, that uſe theſe ceremonies. But yet here is the difference: by Baptiſme every one is ingrafted into the Church: but the Lord would have the Supper of the Lord to be alſo the ſinew of the publique congregation, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The reſt that followeth, pertaineth to the</hi> 15. Sect. <hi>till you come to theſe words that follow.</hi> Even as alſo in the very words of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per there is a promiſe included, ſeeing he commandeth that <hi>the death of the Lord ſhould be ſhewed forth, &amp; this Supper diſtributed, till he come.</hi> That therefore we may uſe this Sacrament with the greater reverence, let the true cauſes of the inſtitution thereof be well weighed, which pertaine to the publique Congregation, and to the comfort of every one. The firſt cauſe is this: The Son of God will have the voice of his Goſpel to ſound in a publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and ſuch a one as is of good behaviour: the bond of this congregation he will have this receiving to be, which is to be done with great reverence, ſeeing that there a teſtimonie is given of the wonderfull conjunction betwixt the Lord and the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: of which reverence <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. ſaying. <hi>He that receiveth unworthily, ſhall be guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> Secondly, God will have both the Sermon, and the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie it ſelfe to be profitable, both for the preſervation, and alſo for the propagation of the memory of his paſſion, reſurrection, and benefits. Thirdly, He will have every receiver to be ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by this teſtimonie, that he may aſſure himſelfe, that the benefits of the Goſpell doe pertaine to him, ſeeing that the Sermon is common: and by this teſtimonie, and by this recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving he ſheweth that thou art a member of his, and that thou art waſhed in his blood, and that he doth make this covenant with thee, <hi>Joh. 15. Abide in me, and I in you.</hi> Alſo, <hi>I in them and they in me.</hi> Fourthly, he will have this publique receiving, to be a confeſſion, whereby thou maiſt ſhew, what kinde of doctrine thou doeſt imbrace, and to what companie thou docſt joyne thy
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61072:186"/> ſelfe. Alſo he will have us to give thanks publiquely, and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this very ceremonie, to God the eternall Father, and to the Sonne, and to the holy Ghoſt, both for other benefits, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this infinite benefit of our redemption and ſalvation. Alſo he will that the members of the Church ſhould have a bond of mutuall love among themſelves. Thus we ſee that many ends doe meet together. By the remembrance of theſe weightie cauſes, men are invited to the reverence and uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and we teach how the uſe may be profitable. We doe plainly condemne that monſtrous errour of the Monks, who have written, that the receiving doth deſerve remiſſion of ſinnes, and that for the works ſake, without any good motion of him that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it. This Phariſaicall imagination is contrary to that ſaying, <hi>Habac. 2. The iuſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> Therefore we doe thus inſtruct the Church, that they which will approach to the Supper of the Lord, muſt repent or bring converſion with them, and having their faith now kindled, they muſt here ſeeke the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this faith, in the conſideration of the death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and benefits of the Sonne of God: becauſe that in the uſe of this Sacrament, there is a witneſſe bearing, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that the benefits of the Sonne of God doe pertaine to thee alſo: alſo there is a teſtimonie, that he joyneth thee as a member to himſelfe, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> and that he is in thee, as he ſaid, <hi>Joh. 17. I in them, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore we give counſell, that men, doe not thinke, that their ſinnes be forgiven them for this works ſake, or for this obedience, but that in a ſure confidence they behold the death and merit of the Sonne of God, and his reſurrection, and aſſure themſelves that their ſins are forgiven for his ſake, and that he will have this faith to be confirmed by this admonition, and witneſſe bearing: when as faith, comfort, the joy of conſcience, and thankſgiving doe after this ſort increaſe, the receiving is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Neither are any <note n="*" place="margin">Look the 2.

                     <p>Alſo men are taught, that Sacraments are actions, inſtituted of God, and that without the uſe whereunto they are ordained, the things themſelves are not to be accounted for a Sacrament: but in the uſe appointed, Chriſt is preſent in this communion, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3 &amp; 4. Obſerv.</note> truly
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61072:186"/> and ſubſtantially, and the body and blood of Chriſt is in deed given to the receivers: in that Chriſt doth witneſſe that he is in them, and doth make them his members, and that he doth waſh them in his blood, as <hi>Hilarie</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>Theſe things being eaten and drunke, doe cauſe, both that we may be in Chriſt, and that Chriſt may be in us.</hi> Moreover in the ceremonie it ſelfe we obſerve the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all order of the whole ancient Church, both Latine and Greeke. We uſe no private Maſſes, that is, ſuch wherein the body and blood of Chriſt was not diſtributed; as alſo the ancient Church, for many yeers after the Apoſtles times, had no ſuch Maſſes, as the the old deſcriptions, which are to be found in <hi>Dionyſius, Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Ambroſe, Auguſtine,</hi> and others, doe ſhew. And <hi>Paul 1 Cor.</hi> 11. Doth command, that the Communion ſhould be celebrated when many do meet together. Therefore in the publike congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and ſuch as is of good behaviour, prayers, and the creed, are rehearſed or ſung, and <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 5. Obſervat.</note> leſſons appointed uſually for holy dayes, are read. After that there is a Sermon of the benefits of the Son of God, and of ſome part of doctrine: as the order of time doth miniſter an argument. Then the Paſtour doth rehearſe a thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and a prayer for the whole Church, for them that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and as the preſent neceſſitie requireth: and he prayeth to God, that for his Sons ſake, whom he would have to be made a ſacrifice for us, he would forgive us our ſins, and ſave us, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and preſerve a Church. Then he rehearſeth the words of Chriſt, concerning the inſtitution of the Supper, and he himſelfe taketh, and diſtributeth to the receivers, the whole Sacrament: who come reverently thereunto, being before examined and abſolved, and there they joyne theirs with the publike prayers. In the end they doe againe give thanks. All men, which are not altogether ignorant of antiquitie, doe know that this rite, and this Communion, doth for the moſt part agree with the writings of the Apoſtles, and with the cuſtome of the ancient Church, even almoſt to <hi>Gregories</hi> time: which thing being ſo, the cuſtome of our Churches is to be approved, not to be diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but our Adverſaries miſliking our cuſtome, doe defend many errours, ſome more foule and groſſe, others coloured with new deceits.</p>
                     <p>Many heretofore have written, that in the maſſe there is an oblation made for the quicke and the dead, and that it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve remiſſion of ſins, both for him that maketh it, and for others,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61072:187"/> even for the works ſake. And thus were moſt of them perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and as yet are like unto the Phariſees, and the heathen. For after the ſame manner the Phariſees &amp; the Heathen did dreame, that they for the works ſake, did deſerve, for themſelves, and for others, remiſſion of ſinnes, peace, and many other good things. Or although thoſe, which were not ſo blind, did ſpeake more modeſtly, and ſaid, that they did deſerve, but not without the good intention of the ſacrificer, yet they imagined that thoſe ſacrifices were merits, and a ranſome. By reaſon of this opinion there were a multitude of ſacrifices, and the craftie meanes of gaine were increaſed. Such is the merchandiſe of Maſſes, and the prophanation of the Lords Supper, almoſt throughout the whole world. But God will have corrupt kindes of worſhip to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and aboliſhed. Therefore we doe ſimply and in deed propound the voice of God, which doth condemne thoſe errours, and with all our heart we affirme before God; and the whole Church in heaven and in earth, that there was one onely ſacrifice propitiatorie, or whereby the wrath of the eternall Father againſt mankinde is pacified, to wit, the whole obedience of the Sonne of God, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who was crucified, and raiſed up againe. This is that onely <hi>Lambe, which taketh away the ſinnes of the world,</hi> Ioh. 1. Of this onely ſacrifice mention is made, <hi>Heb. 10. By one onely ſacrifice he made perfect for ever thoſe that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi> And this ſacrifice is applied to every one, by their owne faith, when they heare the Goſpell, and uſe the Sacraments, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom. 3. Whom God hath ſet forth to be a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through faith in his blood.</hi> And Habac. 2. <hi>The iuſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> And, 1 Pet. 1. <hi>Being ſanctified in the ſpirit, unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſprinkling of the blood of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Other Sacraments in the old Teſtament were typicall: whereof we ſhall ſpeake more at large in their place, and they did not deſerve any remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins: and all the righteouſneſſe of holy men at all times, were, are, and ſhall be ſacrifices of praiſe, which doe not deſerve remiſſion, either for them that did offer them, or for others, but they are ſervices which every one ought to performe: and are acceptable to God for the Mediatours, and our high Prieſt the Son of God his ſake, as it is ſaid, <hi>Heb. 13. By him we offer the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praiſe alwaies to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this is an unchangeable and eternall truth, it is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. And whereas certaine fragments, which they call the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61072:187"/> Canons of the Maſſe, are alledged againſt this ſo cleare light of the truth, it is alſo manifeſt that the Greeke and Latine Canons are very unlike the one to the other, and that the Greeke Canons doe diſagree among themſelves in a moſt wrightie matter: and it appeareth that in the Latine Canon many jagges and pieces were by little and little patched together of ignorant authors. The ancient Church doth uſe the names of <hi>Sacrifice and oblation:</hi> but thereby it underſtandeth the whole action, prayers, a taking of it, a remembrance, faith, a confeſſion, and thankeſgiving. This whole inward and outward action, in every one that is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, and in the whole Church, is indeed a ſacrifice of praiſe, or thankeſgiving and a reaſonable ſervice. And when the Lord ſaith, <hi>Ioh. 4. The true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Lord in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> he affirmeth that in the New Teſtament outward ſacrifices are not commanded, which of neceſſitie ſhould be made, although there were no motions of the holy Ghoſt in the heart, as in the law it was neceſſarie, that the ceremonie of the Paſſeover ſhould be kept. But touching the Supper of the Lord it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. Let every man examine himſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> So the Supper of the Lord doth profit him that uſeth it, when as hee bringeth with him repentance and faith, and another mans work doth nothing at all profit him.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, concerning the dead, it is manifeſt, that all this ſhew is repugnant to the words of the inſtitution of the Supper, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>Take ye, eat ye, &amp;c. Do ye this in remembrance of me.</hi> What doth this appertain to the dead, or to thoſe that be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? and yet in a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> many maſſes are ſaid for the dead: alſo a great number not knowing what they doe, doe reade Maſſes for a reward. But ſeeing that all theſe things are manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, to wit, to offer, as they ſpeak, to the end that they may deſerve for the quick &amp; the dead: or for a man to do he knoweth not what, they do horribly ſin, that retain and defend theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous deeds. And ſeeing that this ceremony is not to be taken for a Sacrament, without the uſe whereunto it was ordained, what manner of Idol worſhip is there uſed, let godly and learned men conſider. Alſo it is a manifeſt profanation, to carry about part of the Supper of the Lord, and to worſhip it: where a part is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly transferred to an uſe clean contrary to the firſt inſtitution, whereas the Text ſaith, <hi>Take, eat:</hi> and this ſhew is but a thing deviſed of late. To conclude, what be the manners of many
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61072:188"/> Prieſts and Monks in all Europe, which have no regard of this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. Let every man examine himſelfe?</hi> Alſo, <hi>Whoſoever taketh it unworthily, ſhall be guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> Every man of him-ſelf doth know theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Now, although the chiefe Biſhops and hypocrites, who ſeeke deluſions to eſtabliſh theſe evils, doe ſcoffe at theſe complaints, yet it is moſt certaine, that God is grievouſly offended with theſe wicked deeds, as he was angry with the people of Iſrael for their prophanations of the ſacrifices. And we do ſee evident examples of wrath, to wit, the ruines of ſo many kingdomes, the ſpoile and waſte that the Turks do make in the world, the confuſions of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and many moſt lamentable diſſipations of Churches. But <hi>O Son of God, Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which waſt crucified and raiſed up again for us, thou which art the high Prieſt of the Church, with true ſighes we beſeech thee, that for thine, and thy eternall Fathers glory, thou wouldeſt take away idols, errours, and abominations: and, as thou thy ſelfe didſt pray, Sanctifie us with thy truth, and kindle the light of thy Goſpel, and true invocation, in the hearts of many, and bowe our hearts to true obedience, that we may thankefully praiſe thee in all eternitie. The greatneſſe of our ſins, which the prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Supper of the Lord theſe many yeers hath brought forth, doth ſurpaſſe the eloquence of Angels and men.</hi> We are herein the ſhorter, ſeeing that no words can be deviſed ſufficient, to ſet out the greatneſſe of this thing, and in this great griefe we beſeech the Sonne of God, that he would amend theſe evils, and alſo for a further declaration, we offer our ſelves to them, that will heare it. But in this queſtion we ſee that to be chiefly done, which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that ſingeth ſongs to a wicked heart, is like him that powreth vineger upon nitre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Adverſaries know, that theſe perſwaſions of their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, are the ſinews of their power and riches: therefore they will heare nothing that is ſaid againſt it. Some of them do now learn craftily to mitigate theſe things, and therefore they ſay, The oblation is not a merit, but an application: they deceive in words, and retaine ſtill the ſame abuſes. But we ſaid before, that every one doth by faith apply the ſacrifice of Chriſt to himſelfe, both when he heareth the Goſpel, and then alſo, when he uſeth the Sacraments: and it is written, 1 <hi>Corinth. 11. Let every man examine himſelfe.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth not meane, that the ceremonie doth profit another that doth not uſe it. And, the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61072:188"/> Son of God himſelfe did offer up himſelfe, going into the holy of holies, that is, into the ſecret counſell of the Divinitie, ſeeing the will of the eternall Father, and bearing his great wrath, and underſtanding the cauſes of this wonderfull counſell: theſe weightie things are meant, when the text ſaith, <hi>Heb. 9. He offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe.</hi> And when <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cap. 53. He will make his ſoule an offering for ſin.</hi> Now therefore what do the Prieſts meane, who ſay, that they offer up Chriſt? and yet antiquitie never ſpake after this manner. But they do moſt grievouſly accuſe us. They ſay, that <hi>we do take away the continuall ſacrifice, as did Antiochus, who was a type of Antichriſt.</hi> We anſwered before, that we do retaine the whole ceremonie of the Apoſtolike Church: and this is the continuall ſacrifice, That the ſincere doctrin of the Goſpel ſhould be heard, that God ſhould be truly invocated: to conclude, as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Joh. 4. It is to worſhip the Father in ſpirit and truth:</hi> we doe alſo herein comprehend the true uſe of the Sacraments. Seeing that we retaine all theſe things faithfully, we doe with great reverence retaine the continuall ſacrifice, they doe aboliſh it, who many waies doe corrupt true invocation, and the very Supper of the Lord, who command us to invocate dead men, who ſet out Maſſes to ſale, who boaſt, that by their oblation they doe merit for others, who doe mingle many miſchievous errours with the doctrine of Repentance and remiſſion of ſins, who will men to doubt, when they repent, whether they be in favour, who defile the Church of God with filthy luſts and Idols. Theſe men be like unto <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and not we, who endeavour to obey the Son of God, who ſaith, <hi>Joh. 4. If any man loveth me, he will keepe my word.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>VVE beleeve and confeſſe that the Euchariſt (for ſo it pleaſed our forefathers to call the Supper of the Lord) is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſtituted of Chriſt himſelfe, and that the uſe thereof is commended to the Church, even to the latter end of the world. But becauſe the ſubſtance is one thing, and the uſe thereof ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, therefore we will ſpeake of theſe in order. Touching the ſubſtance of the Euchariſt, we thus thinke and teach, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this confeſſion.</note> that the true body of Chriſt, and his true blood is diſtributed in the Euchariſt: and we refute them that ſay, that the bread and wine of the Euchariſt, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. Obſervat.</note> are ſignes of the body and blood of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely abſent. Alſo we beleeve that the omnipotencie of God is ſo great, that in the Euchariſt he may either annihilate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bread and wine, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. obſervation.</note> or elſe change them into the body and blood of Chriſt: but that God doth exerciſe this his abſolute omnipotencie in the Euchariſt, we have no certaine word of God for it, and it is evident, that the ancient Church was altogether ignorant of it. For as in <hi>Ezech.</hi> where it is ſaid of the Citie of Hieruſalem, deſcribed on the out ſide of a wall, <hi>This is Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> it was not neceſſary that the ſubſtance of the wall ſhould be changed into the ſubſtance of the Citie of Hieruſalem; ſo when it is ſaid of the bread, <hi>This is my body,</hi> it is not neceſſary that the ſubſtance of bread ſhould be changed into the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt: <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 4. obſervation.</note> but for the truth of the Sacrament it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that the body of Chriſt is in deed preſent with the bread: and in deed the very neceſſitie of the truth of the Sacrament doth ſeeme to require, that true bread ſhould remaine, with the true preſence of the body of Chriſt. For as to the truth of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme it is neceſſary, that in the uſe thereof there ſhould be water, and that true water ſhould remaine; ſo it is
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:61072:191"/> neceſſary in the Lords Supper, that there ſhould be bread in the uſe thereof, and that true bread ſhould remaine, whereas if the ſubſtance of bread were changed, we ſhould have no proofe of the truth of the Sacrament. Whereupon both <hi>Paul,</hi> and alſo the ancient Eccleſiaſticall Writers doe call the bread of the Euchariſt, even after conſecration, bread. 1 <hi>Cor. 11. Let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſo let him eate of that bread, &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup of the Lord unworthily,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Sermon to young children ſaith: <hi>That which you have ſeene, it is the bread, and the cup, the which thing alſo your eyes doe witneſſe unto you: but that which your faith deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to learne, is this: the bread, is the body of Chriſt, the cup, is his blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as touching the uſe of the Euchariſt, firſt, although we doe not denie, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 5. obſervation.</note> but that whole Chriſt is diſtributed, as well in the bread, as in the wine of the Euchariſt: yet we teach, that the uſe of either part ought to be common to the whole Church. For it is evident, that Chriſt being nothing at all terrified by any dangers, which afterward humane ſuperſtition invented, or by other deviſes, gave unto his Church both parts to be uſed. Alſo it is evident, that the ancient Church did uſe both parts for many yeeres. And certaine Writers doe clearely witneſſe, that <hi>they which doe receive bread alone, doe not receive the whole Sacrament Sacramentally</hi> (for ſo they ſpeake) and that <hi>it is not poſsible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide one and the ſelf ſame myſtery, without great ſacriledge.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we thinke that the uſe of both parts is in deed Catholike and Apoſtolike, and that it is not lawfull for any man, at his pleaſure to change this inſtitution of Chriſt, and a ceremony of ſuch conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in the ancient and true Church, and to take away from the Laitie, as they call them, one part of the Euchariſt. And it is to be marvelled at, that they who profeſſe themſelves to defend the ceremonies of the ancient Church, ſhould ſo farre ſwarve from the ancient Church in this point. Moreover, ſeeing that the word <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is very large, and doth generally ſignifie a holy worſhip, we doe willingly grant, that the true and lawfull uſe of the Euchariſt may in this ſenſe be called a Sacrifice: howbeit the Euchariſt, according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, is ſo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, that therein the death of Chriſt is ſhewed forth, and the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt is diſtributed to the Church, and ſo it is truely called an applying of the merit of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:61072:192"/> the paſſion of Chriſt, to wit, to them, which receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>Neither doe we condemne godly leſſons, and prayers, which uſe to goe before, and to follow conſecration, as they call it, and the diſpenſation of the Euchariſt: yet in the meane time it is not lawfull for us, to diſſemble, or to allow of thoſe errours, which have been added to this holy Sacrament, rather by the ignorance of private men, then by any lawfull conſent of the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. One errour is this, that of the worſhip, which ought to be common to the Church, there is made a private action of one Prieſt, who as he doth alone to himſelf mumble up the words of the Lords Supper, ſo alſo he alone doth receive the bread and wine. For Chriſt did inſtitute the Euchariſt, not that it ſhould be a private action of one man, but that it ſhould be a communion of the Church. <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 6. obſervation.</note> Therefore to the right action of the Euchariſt, two things at the leſt are requiſite, to wit, the Miniſter of the Euchariſt, who bleſſeth, and he, to whom the Sacrament of the Euchariſt is diſpenſed. For when Chriſt did inſtitute this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he did not eate thereof alone, but he did diſpenſe it to his Church, which then was preſent with him, ſaying, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>Drinke ye all of this, &amp;c.</hi> This inſtitution of Chriſt the ancient and true Catholike Church did ſo ſeverely obſerve, that it excommunicated them, which being preſent whileſt this holy Sacrament was adminiſtred, would not communicate with others. <hi>Anacletus</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle ſaith, <hi>After that conſecration is finiſhed, let all communicate, except they had rather ſtand without the Church doores.</hi> And he addeth, <hi>For ſo both the Apoſtles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and the holy Church of Rome keepeth it ſtill.</hi> Alſo, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochian Councell, cap. 2. ſaith: <hi>All thoſe which come into the Church of God, and heare the holy Scriptures, but doe not communicate with the people in prayer, and cannot abide to receive the Sacrament of the Lord, according to a certaine proper diſcipline, theſe men muſt be caſt out of the Church.</hi> Dionyſius in his book, <hi>De Eccleſ. Hierarc.</hi> ſaith; <hi>The Biſhop, when he hath praiſed the divine gifts, then he maketh the holy, and moſt excellent myſteries: and thoſe things which before he had praiſed, being covered and hid under reverent ſignes, he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into ſight, and reverently ſhewing forth the divine gifts, both he himſelfe doth turne to the holy participation thereof, and doth exhort the others to participate them: to conclude, when the holy communion is received, and delivered to all, he rendering thanks, doth make an end of theſe myſteries.</hi> Therefore we thinke it neceſſary, to the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61072:192"/> remining of the inſtitution of Chriſt in the celebration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and that we may follow the example of the ancient and true Catholike Church, that the private Maſſes of the Prieſts may be abrogated, and that the publique communion of the Lords Supper may be reſtored.</p>
                  <p>Another errour is this, that the Euchariſt is ſuch a ſacrifice, as ought to be offered daily in the Church, for the purging of the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead, and for the obtaining of other benefits, both corporall and ſpirituall. This error is evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Goſpel of Chriſt, which witneſſeth; <hi>That Chriſt, by one oblation, once onely made, hath made perfect for ever thoſe that be ſanctified.</hi> And, becauſe that Chriſt by his paſſion and death, hath purchaſed remiſſion of ſinnes for us, which alſo is declared unto us by the Goſpel in the new Teſtament, therefore it is not lawfull to ſacrifice any more for ſinne: for the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Where there is remiſſion of ſinnes, there is no further oblation for ſinne.</hi> For whereas Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> he doth not command to offer his body and blood in the Supper unto God, but to the Church: that the Church, by eating the bodie, and drinking the blood of Chriſt; and by ſhewing forth the benefit of his death, may be admoniſhed of that oblation of the body and blood of Chriſt which was made once onely on the Croſſe for the purging of our ſins. For ſo <hi>Paul</hi> doth interpret this ſaying of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>So often as ye ſhall eate</hi> (he doth not ſay, offer) <hi>this bread, and drinke this cup, ſhew ye forth the death of the Lord, till he come.</hi> And truly we confeſſe, that the ancient Eccleſiaſticall writers did call the Euchariſt <hi>a ſacrifice, and an oblation:</hi> but they expound themſelves, that by the name of Sacrifice they meane a remembrance, a ſhewing forth or a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of that Sacrifice, which Chriſt did once offer upon the Croſſe as alſo they call the memoriall of the Paſſeover, and of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, the Paſſeover and Pentecoſt it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The third errour is this, that many doe thinke, that the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as they call it) of the Euchariſt, is not of it ſelfe a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſinnes, but that it doth apply the propitiation and merit of Chriſt to the quick and the dead. But we have already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Euchariſt properly is not an oblation, but is ſo called, becauſe it is a remembrance of the oblation, which was once made on the Croſſe. Moreover, the application of the merit of Chriſt, is not made by any other outward inſtrument, then by
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:61072:193"/> the preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and by diſpenſing thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which Chriſt hath inſtituted for this uſe: and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt being offered, and applied, is not received but by faith, <hi>Mark 16. Preach the Goſpel to every creature.</hi> For by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Goſpel the benefits of Chriſt be offered, and applied to creatures, that is, either to the Iewes, or to the Gentiles. And it followeth, <hi>He that ſhall beleeve, and be baptiſed, he ſhall be ſaved:</hi> becauſe that by the receiving of the Sacrament, and by faith, the benefits offered, and applied, be received, <hi>Rom. 1. The Goſpel is the power of God to ſalvation, to every one that beleeveth:</hi> that is, the miniſtery of the Goſpel is the inſtrument ordained of God, whereby God is able and effectuall, to ſave all thoſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Goſpel. Therefore the preaching of the Goſpel doth offer, or, if it liketh any man ſo to ſpeake, doth apply ſalvation to all men, but faith doth receive ſalvation offered and applied. Now in the private Maſſe, bread and wine are ſo handled, that the Prieſt doth neither publikely declare the Goſpel of Chriſt, but doth ſoftly mumble up to himſelfe certaine words, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the words of the Supper, or of conſecration: neither doth he diſtribute bread and wine to others, but he alone taketh them: therefore there can be no applying of the merit of Chriſt in the private Maſſe. This did our true Catholique Elders well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, who, as we have declared before, did ſo ſeverely require, that they which were preſent at the Maſſe, and did not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, ſhould be excommunicated.</p>
                  <p>The fourth errour is this, which we have already touched, in that they doe require, that the words of the Supper, or of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, may be rehearſed ſoftly in the Euchariſt, ſeeing that theſe words are a part of that Goſpel, which according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Chriſt, is to be preached to all creatures. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Anceſtors did ſometimes call the Euchariſt <hi>a myſtery,</hi> yet they did not ſo call it with this purpoſe, that they would not have the words of the Supper to be rehearſed before the Church in the Euchariſt publikely, and in a tongue commonly knowne, but becauſe that in the Euchariſt one thing is ſeene, and another thing underſtood. For Chriſt himſelfe is alſo called <hi>a myſterie,</hi> who nevertheleſſe is not to be hid, but to be preached to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And becauſe that in the receiving of the Sacrament it is neceſſarily required, that we ſhould have faith, and <hi>faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the wora of God,</hi> it is moſt neceſſarie,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:61072:193"/> that in the Euchariſt the word of the Supper, that is, the word of the Sonne of God, ſhould be publiquely rehearſed: for this word is the preaching of the Goſpel, and the ſhewing forth of the death of Chriſt. Therefore that the Church may underſtand what is done in the Euchariſt, and what is offered unto her to be received, and that ſhe may confirme her faith, it is neceſſary, that in the Euchariſt the words of the Lords Supper ſhould be rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed publiquely.</p>
                  <p>The fifth errour is this, that one part of the Euchariſt is uſed in ſhew of a ſingular worſhip of God, to be carried about, and to be laid up. But the holy Ghoſt doth forbid, that any worſhip of God ſhould be appointed without the expreſſe commandement of God. <hi>Deut. 12. You ſhall not doe every one of you, that which ſeemeth good in his owne eyes.</hi> And againe, <hi>That which I command thee, that onely ſhalt thou doe to the Lord: ſee that thou adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereunto, nor detract any thing from it.</hi> And <hi>Matth. 15. In vaine do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the precepts of men. Clemens</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>James,</hi> and in three Chapters, <hi>De Conſecr. Diſt.</hi> 2. ſaith, <hi>Certainely ſo great burnt offerings are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on the Altar, as may be ſufficient for the people: if ſo be that any thing remaine till the next day, let them not be kept, but with feare and trembling, by the diligence of the Clearkes, let them be conſumed.</hi> We are not ignorant, how they uſe to delude theſe words of <hi>Clemens,</hi> by feigning a difference betwixt the worke of thoſe that are ready to die, and thoſe that be ready to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate. But it is evident, that the bread, which uſeth to be carried about, and to be laid up to be adored, is not reſerved for thoſe that be weake, but in the end is received of them that doe conſecrate. <hi>Cyrill,</hi> or, as others thinke, <hi>Origen,</hi> upon the ſeventh Chapter of <hi>Levit.</hi> ſaith, <hi>For the Lord concerning that bread, which he gave to his Diſciples, ſaid unto them, Take it, and eate it, &amp;c. He did not differ it, neither did he command it to be reſerved till the next day. Peradventure there is this myſterie alſo contained therein, that he doth not command the bread to be carried in the high way, that thou maiſt alwaies bring forth the freſh loaves of the word of God, which thou carrieſt within thee, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>AS touching this reverent Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt, all thoſe things which the Evangeliſts, <hi>Paul,</hi> and the holy Fathers have left in writing thereof, our men doe ſincerely teach, commend, and inculcate: and thence they doe with a ſingular indeavour alwaies publiſh this goodneſſe of Chriſt towards his, whereby he doth no leſſe at this day, then he did in that his laſt Supper, vouchſafe to give, by the Sacraments his true bodie, and his true blood, to be eaten, and to be drunke, indeed, as the meate and drinke of their ſoules, whereby they may be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed unto life eternall: he giveth it, I ſay, to all thoſe, who from their hearts have their names, to be reckoned among his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when as they doe receive this Supper, according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: ſo that now he may live and abide in them, and they in him, and be raiſed up by him in the laſt day, to a new, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, according to thoſe words of eternall truth. <hi>Take, and eate, This is my body, &amp;c. Drinke ye all of this, This cup is my blood, &amp;c.</hi> Now, our Preachers doe moſt diligently withdraw the mindes of the people, both from all contention, and alſo from all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and curious inquirie, unto that which onely is profitable, and whereunto onely Chriſt our Saviour had reſpect: to wit, that being fed with him, we may live in him, and through him, and leade ſuch a life, as is acceptable to God, holy, and therefore everlaſting and bleſſed: and withall, that we among our ſelves may be one bread, and one body, which are partakers of one bread in that holy Supper. Whereby it cometh to paſſe, that we doe very religiouſly, and with a ſingular reverence both admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and receive the Divine Sacraments, that is, the holy Supper of Chriſt. By theſe things which are thus indeed, as we have ſet them downe, your ſacred Majeſtie, O moſt gracious Emperour, doth know, how falſely our adverſaries doe boaſt, that our men doe change the words of Chriſt, and teare them in peeces by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane gloſſes, and that in our Suppers nothing is adminiſtred but meere bread, and meere wine, and alſo that among us the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord is contemned, and rejected. For our men doe
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61072:194"/> very carefully teach and exhort, that every man doe in a ſimple faith imbrace theſe words of the Lord, rejecting all deviſes of men, and falſe gloſſes, and removing away all kinde of wavering, doe wholly addict their minde to the true meaning thereof: and to conclude, doe oftentimes, with as great reverence as they may, receive the Sacraments, to be the lively food of their ſoules, and to ſtirre up in them a gratefull remembrance of ſo great a benefit: the which thing alſo uſeth now to be done among us, much more often and reverently, then heretofore was uſed. Moreover, our Preachers have alwaies hitherto, and at this day doe offer themſelves with all modeſtie and truth, to render a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their faith and doctrine, touching all thoſe things which they beleeve and teach, as well about the Sacrament, as about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, and that not onely to your Sacred Majeſtie, but alſo to every one that ſhall demand it.</p>

                     <p>FVrthermore, ſeeing that after this manner, Chriſt hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted his Supper, which afterward began to be called the Maſſe, to wit, that therein the faithfull being fed with his body and blood, unto life eternall, ſhould ſhew forth his death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are redeemed; our Preachers by this mean giving thanks, and alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending this ſalvation unto others, could not chuſe but condemne it, that theſe things were every where neglected. And on the other ſide, they which do celebrate the Maſſes, do preſume to offer up Chriſt unto his Father, for the quicke and the dead, and they make the Maſſe, to be ſuch a worke, as that by it alone almoſt, the favour of God and ſalvation is obtained, howſoever they doe either beleeve, or live. Whereupon that moſt ſhamefull and twiſe and thriſe impious ſale of this Sacrament hath crept in, and thereby it is come to paſſe that nothing at this day, is more gainefull then the Maſſe.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61072:195"/> Chriſt inſtead of a ſacrifice,</hi> they are therefore condemned of our men, becauſe that the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth plainly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>that as men doe once die, ſo Christ was once offered that he</hi>

                        <hi>might take away the ſinnes of many, and that he can no more be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered againe, then he may die againe: and therefore having offered one ſacrifice for ſinnes, he ſitteth for ever at the right hand of God, waiting for that which remaineth, to wit, that his enemies, as it</hi>

                        <hi>were a footſtoole, may be trodden under his feet. For with one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath he conſecrated for ever them, that are ſanctified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas they have made the Maſſe to be a good worke, whereby any thing may be obtained at Gods hands, our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers have taught, that it is repugnant to that, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth teach in every place, that we are juſtified, and receive the favour of God, by the ſpirit of Chriſt and by faith: for which matter we alledged before many teſtimonies out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. So in that the death of the Lord is not commended to the people in the Maſſe, our Preachers have ſhewed that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, that Chriſt commanded, to receive theſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>in remembrance of himſelfe:</hi> and <hi>Paul, that we might ſhew forth the death of Chriſt, till he come.</hi> And whereas many doe commonly celebrate the Maſſes, without all regard of godlineſſe, onely for this cauſe, that they may nouriſh their bodies, our Preachers have ſhewed, that that is ſo execrable a thing before God, that if the Maſſe of it ſelfe ſhould nothing at all hinder god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, yet worthily and by the commandement of God, it were to be aboliſhed: the which thing is evident even out of <hi>Eſay</hi> onely. For <hi>our God is a Spirit, and truth, and therefore he cannot</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>abide to be worſhipped, but in Spirit and truth.</hi> And how grievous a thing this unreaſonable ſelling of the Sacraments is unto the Lord, our Preachers would have men thereby to conjecture, that <hi>Chriſt did</hi> ſo ſharply, and altogether againſt his accuſtomed manner, taking unto himſelfe an externall kinde of revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>caſt out of the temple thoſe that bought and ſold,</hi> whereas they might ſeeme to exerciſe merchandize, onely in this reſpect, that they might further thoſe ſacrifices, which were offered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, ſeeing that the rite of the Maſſe, which was wont to be celebrated, is ſo many waies contrarie to the Scripture of God, as alſo it is in every reſpect divers from that, which the holy Fathers uſed, it hath beene very vehemently condemned
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61072:195"/> amongſt us out of the pulpit, and by the word of God it is made ſo deteſtable, that many of their owne accord have altogether forſaken it: and elſe where, by the authoritie of the Magiſtrate, it is abrogated. The which thing we have not taken upon us for any other cauſe, then for that throughout the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Spirit of God doth deteſt nothing ſo much, neither command it ſo earneſtly to be taken away, as a feigned and falſe worſhip of himſelfe. Now, no man that hath any ſparke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in him, can be ignorant, what an inevitable neceſſitie is laid upon him that feareth God, when as he is perſwaded, that God doth require a thing at his hands For any man may eaſily foreſee, how many would take it at our hands, that we ſhould change any thing about the holy rite of the Maſſe, neither were there any, which would not rather have choſen in this point, not onely not to have offended your ſacred Majeſtie, but even any Prince of the loweſt degree. But when as herewithall they did not doubt, but by that common rite of the Maſſe, God was moſt grievouſly provoked, and that his glory, for the which we ought to ſpend our lives, was darkened, they could not but take it away, leſt that they alſo, by wincking at it, ſhould make themſelves partakers with them in diminiſhing the glory of God. Truely if God is to be loved, and worſhipped above all, godly men muſt beare nothing leſſe, then that which he doth hate and deteſt: And that this one cauſe did conſtraine us to change certaine things in theſe points, we take him to witneſſe, from whom no ſecret is hid.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it be lawfull for all men, privately at home to reade the holy Scriptures, and by inſtruction to edifie one another in the true Religion, yet that the word of God may be lawfully preached to the people, and prayers and ſupplications publikely made, and that the Sacraments may be lawfully miniſtred, that that collection be made for the poore, and to defray all neceſſarie charges of the Church, or to ſupply the wants, it is very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full there ſhould be holy meetings and Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies. For it is manifeſt that in the Apoſtolike and Primitive Church there were ſuch aſſemblies frequented of godly men. So many then as doe deſpiſe them, and ſeparate themſelves from them, they are contemners of true Religion, and are to be compelled by the Paſtours and godly Magiſtrates, to ſurceaſe ſtubbornly to ſeparate and abſent themſelves from ſacred aſſemblies. Now Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies muſt not be hidden and ſecret, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and common, except perſecution by the enemies of Chriſt and the Church will not ſuffer them to be publique. For we know what manner aſſemblies the Primitive Church had heretofore in ſecret corners, being under the tyrannie of Roman Emperours. Let thoſe places where the faithfull meet together be decent, and in all reſpects fit for Gods Church. Therefore let houſes be choſen for that purpoſe, or Churches that are large
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:61072:196"/> and faire, ſo that they be purged from all ſuch things, as doe not beſeeme the Church. And let all things be ordered, as is moſt meete for comelineſſe, neceſſitie, and godly decencie, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be wanting which is requiſite for rites and orders, and the neceſſarie uſes of the Church.</p>
                     <p>And as we beleeve that God doth not dwel in temples made with hands, ſo we know that by reaſon of the word of God, and holy exerciſes therein celebrated, places dedicated to God and his worſhip are not prophane, but holy, and that therefore ſuch as are converſant in them, ought to behave themſelves reverently and modeſtly, as they which are in a ſacred place, in the preſence of God and his holy Angels. All exceſſe of apparell therefore is to be abandoned from Churches and places where Chriſtians meet in prayer, together with all pride, and whatſoever elſe doth not beſeeme Chriſtian humilitie, decencie, and modeſtie. For the true ornament of Churches doth not conſiſt in Ivorie, gold, and precious ſtones, but in the ſobrietie, godlineſſe, and vertues of thoſe, which are in the Church. <hi>Let all things be done comely and orderly in the Church:</hi> to conclude, <hi>Let all things be done to edifying.</hi> Therefore let all ſtrange tongues keepe ſilence in the holy aſſemblies, and let all things be uttered in the vulgar tongue, which is underſtood of all men in the company.</p>

                     <p>TRue it is, that a man may lawfully pray privately in any tongue that he doth underſtand: but publique prayers ought in the holy aſſemblies to be made in the vulgar tongue, or ſuch a language as is known to all. Let all the prayers of the faithfull be powred forth to God alone through the mediation of Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, out of a true faith and pure love. As for invocation of Saints, or uſing them as interceſſors, to intreat for us, the Prieſthood of our Lord Chriſt and true religion will not permit us. Prayer muſt be made for Magiſtracie, for Kings and all that are placed in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for Miniſters of the Church, and for all neceſſities of Churches in any calamity, &amp; ſpecially in the calamity of the Church, prayer muſt be made both privatly, and publikely, without ceaſing. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over we muſt pray willingly, and not by conſtraint, nor for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: neither muſt we ſuperſtitiouſly tie prayer to any place, as
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:61072:197"/> though it were not lawfull to pray but in the Church. There is no neceſſity, that publike prayers ſhould be in forme and time the ſame or alike in all Churches. Let all Churches uſe their libertie. <hi>Socrates</hi> in his hiſtory ſaith, <hi>In any countrey or nation whereſoever, you ſhall not finde two Churches which doe wholely agree in prayer:</hi> The authors of this difference I think were thoſe which had the government of the Churches in all ages. If ſo be any do agree, it deſerveth great commendation, and is to be imitated of others.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this, there muſt be a meane and meaſure, as in every other thing, ſo alſo in publique prayers, that they be not overlong, and tedious: let therefore the moſt time be given to teaching of the Goſpel, in ſuch holy aſſemblies: and let there be diligent heed taken, that the people in the Aſſemblies be not wearied with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlong prayers, ſo as when the preaching of the Goſpel ſhould be heard, they through weariſomneſſe either deſire to goe forth themſelves, or to have the aſſembly wholly diſmiſſed. For unto ſuch the Sermons ſeeme to be overlong, which otherwiſe are briefe enough. Yea and the Preachers ought to keepe a meane. Likewiſe the ſinging in ſacred aſſemblies ought to be moderated, where it is in uſe. That ſong, which they call <hi>Gregories</hi> ſong, hath many groſſe things in it. Wherefore it is upon good cauſe reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of ours, and of all other reformed Churches. If there be any Churches which have faithfull prayer in good manner, and no ſinging at all, they are not therefore to be condemned: for all Churches have not the commoditie and opportunitie of ſinging. And certaine it is by teſtimonies of antiquitie, that as the cuſtome of ſinging hath been very ancient in the Eaſt Churches, ſo it was long or it was received in the Weſt Churches.</p>
                     <p>In ancient time there were <hi>Canonicall houres,</hi> that is, known prayers framed for certain houres in the day, and chanted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, oft repeated, as the Papiſts manner is: which may be proved by many of their leſſons appointed in their houres and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments. Moreover they have many abſurd things (that I ſay no more) and therefore are well omitted of our Churches, that have brought in their ſtead matters more wholeſome for the whole Church of God.</p>

Now for as much as it is evident by the writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, that God had no leſſe care of the youth of this new people, ſeeing he ſaith, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, for of ſuch is the kingdome of heaven;</hi> Therefore the Paſtours doe very wiſely, which doe diligently and betimes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſe their youth, laying the firſt grounds of faith, and faithfully teaching the principles of our Religion, by expounding the Ten Commandements, the Apoſtles Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the doctrine of the Sacraments, with other like principles and chiefe heads of our Religion.

                     <p>THe Church of Chriſt hath riches through the bountifulneſſe of Princes, and the liberality of the faithfull, who have given their goods to the Church: for the Church hath need of ſuch goods: and hath had goods from ancient time, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of things neceſſarie for the Church. Now the true uſe of the Church goods, was, and now is, to maintaine learning in Schooles, and in holy aſſemblies, with all the ſervice, rites, and buildings of the Church: finally to maintaine teachers, ſchollers, and miniſters, with other neceſſary things, and chiefly for the ſuccour and reliefe of the poore. But for the lawfull diſpenſing of theſe Eccleſiaſticall goods, let men be choſen that feare God, wiſe men, and ſuch as are of good report for government of their families. But if the goods of the Church by injurie of the time, and the boldneſſe, ignorance, or covetouſneſſe of ſome turned
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61072:198"/> to any abuſe, let them be reſtored againe, by godly and wiſe men, unto their holy uſe: for they muſt not winke at ſo impious an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe. Therefore we teach that Schooles and Colledges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into corruption is crept in doctrine, in the ſervice of God, and in manners, muſt be reformed, that there muſt order be taken, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, faithfully, and wiſely, for the reliefe of the poore.</p>

                  <p>IN the ſecond place they teach the Chriſtian Catechiſme, that is, a Catholique doctrine, and an inſtruction made with the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61072:198"/> mouth, which agreeth in Chriſtianiſme, with the ancient Church and holy fathers: and this doctrine or inſtruction is the inward or ſecret thing, and the marrow, and the keie to the whole ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, and containeth the ſumme thereof: It is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Ten Commandements, in the Catholike, Chriſtian, and Apoſtolike Creed, wherein be 12. Articles, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded &amp; confirmed, by the Nicene and Athanaſius his Creed, and by godly, Catholique, and generall Councels: alſo, in the forme of prayers, to wlt, of that holy prayer which the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and in a ſummarie doctrine touching the Sacraments, and ſuch duties, as we owe, or be proper, regard being had to every mans place and order, in divers and diſtinct kindes of life, whereunto he is called of God: and there is an open confeſſion and profeſſion made, that this Chriſtian doctrine is that true, full, perfect, and well pleaſed will of God, neceſſarie to every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtian unto ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>This Catechiſme, which doth contain in it the full and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine of Chriſtianiſme, &amp; the knowledge of moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie things ſpoken of before, our Preachers do uſe in ſtead of a ſure rule, method, and table of all thoſe things which they teach, and of all their ſermons &amp; writings: and this they do faithfully care for, and beſtow all their labour therein, that this whole ordinary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the principles of true faith, and Chriſtian godlineſſe, and the doctrine of the foundation, may be imprinted in the bottome of the hearts of Chriſtians, and throughly ingrafted in the mindes and life of the hearers, and that after this manner. Firſt that all may know, that they are bound to yeeld an inward and outward obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the law: and therfore they muſt endevour to performe and fulfill the commandements of God, both in their heart, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the law is ſpirituall, and in their deeds, by loving God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, and their neighbour as themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they muſt well learne and beare in minde, and be able readily to rehearſe, and to beleeve from the heart, to keepe, and to profeſſe with the mouth, the chiefe points of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, Chriſtian, and Apoſtolike Creed, and to teſtifie a Chriſtian pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctie by actions, or manners, and a life which may beſeeme it. Therefore they do alſo in their ſermons, by expounding it, lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the true and ſound meaning, and every myſterie, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to eternall ſalvation, and is comprehended in the articles of faith, and in every part thereof, and confirme it by teſtimonies
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61072:199"/> taken out of the holy Scriptures, and by theſe holy Scriptures, they do either more largely or briefly declare, expound, and lay open the meaning, and the myſteries. And in all theſe things they doe ſo behave themſelves, that concerning the order which the Apoſtles brought in and propounded, they labour to inſtruct not onely thoſe which be of riper yeers, who being come to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full age, are able preſently to underſtand; but alſo to teach lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children, that they being exerciſed, even from their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in the chiefe points of the covenant of God, may be taught to underſtand the true worſhip of God. For this cauſe, there be both peculiar Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies with children, which doe ſerve for the exerciſe of catechizing: and alſo the parents, and thoſe that are requeſted of the parents, and uſed for witneſſes (who are called godfathers, and godmothers) at Baptiſme, are put in minde of the dutie, and faith, which they owe, that they alſo may faithfully inſtruct their beloved children, traine them up in the diſcipline of the Lord, and from the bottome of their hearts,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. Col. 3.</note> pray unto God for theſe, and all other the children of the faithfull of Chriſt. But chiefly they which are newly inſtructed, before they be lawfully admitted to the Supper of the Lord, are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently taught the Chriſtian Catechiſme, and the principles of true religion, and by this meanes they are furthered towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſaving repentance, vertue, and the efficacie of faith. Afterward, all the reſt are alſo inſtructed, that all together being lightned with the knowledge of God, and of the Saints, every man may walk, with all honeſty and godlineſſe, in his place, and in that order, whereunto he is called of God, and may by this means ſanctifie the name of God, and adorne the true doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the Catechiſme theſe things are taught, to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate one true God in a ſure confidence, in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to pray, and that not for themſelves onely, and their private affaires, but alſo for the whole Chriſtian Church, in all countries, for the Miniſters of the Church, and alſo for the civill Magiſtrate, who is ordained of God, and chiefly for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and your Princely Majeſtie, for his moſt noble children, and whole poſteritie, for his counſellors, and all thoſe that be ſubject to his government, praying, that it would pleaſe our gracious God to grant and to give unto your Princely and his Royall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, a long life, heaped with all good things, and a happy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and alſo a benigne, gentle, and fatherly minde and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61072:199"/> of heart toward all thoſe that behave themſelves upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are well affected, doe humbly obey, doe ſhew themſelves faithfull and loving ſubjects, and thoſe that doe in truth worſhip God the Father, and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. And, to be briefe, we teach, that prayers may be made faithfully for all men, for<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.</note> our friends and enemies, as the doctrine of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles doth command us, and as examples doe ſhew, that the very firſt and holy Church did. For which cauſe, we are alſo inſtant with the people, that they would diligently and in great numbers frequent the holy aſſemblies, and there be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, out of this word of God, to make earneſt and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent prayers.</p>
                  <p>Now whatſoever is contrarie to this Catholique and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian kinde of Catechizing, all that we doe forſake and reject, and it is ſtrongly confuted by ſure reaſons, and ſuch as do leane unto the foundations of the holy Scripture, ſo farre forth as God doth give us grace hereunto, and the people is admoniſhed to take heed of ſuch.</p>

                     <p>GOd will have the miniſterie of the Goſpel to be publique, he will not have the voice of the Goſpel to be ſhut up in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners onely, but he will have it to be heard, he will have him ſelfe to be knowne and invocated of all mankinde. Therefore hee would that there ſhould be publique and wel ordered meetings, and in theſe he will have the voice of the Goſpel to found, there he will be invocated, and praiſed. Alſo he will that theſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſhould be witneſſes of the confeſſion and ſevering of the Church of God from the ſects and opinions of other nations. <hi>Iohn</hi> aſſembled his flock at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and taught the Goſpel: and by the uſe of the Sacraments, the whole companie did declare, that they imbraced this doctrine, and did invocate this God, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Goſpel, and that they were ſeparated from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of <hi>Diana, Iupiter,</hi> and other Idols. For God will bee ſeene, and have his Church heard in the world, and have it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by many publique ſignes from other nations. So no doubt the firſt Fathers, <hi>Adam, Seth, Enoch, Noe, Sem, Abraham,</hi> had their meetings: and afterward the civill government of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had many rites, that their ſeparation from the Gentiles might be more evident. Alſo God gave a peculiar promiſe to his congregation, <hi>Matth. 18. Whereſoever two or three be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my name, I will be in the middeſt of them.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Whatſoever they agreeing together, ſhall deſire, it ſhall be done to them.</hi> And in the 149.

                     <p>IN many places the Churches want Paſtours, or elſe Paſtours want living. Theſe men ought chiefly to be relieved, out of the revenues of rich Monaſteries: then the ſtudies of thoſe which be poore muſt thereby be furthered, and in ſome places Schooles may be erected, eſpecially ſeeing that it is neceſſary that the Church ſhould diſcharge the expences of many poore, that they might learne, that ſo out of that number Paſtours and Miniſters may be choſen, to teach the Churches. Alſo hoſpitals are thence to be relieved, wherein it is neceſſary, that the poore, which have beene ſick a long time, ſhould be nouriſhed. A great part of the revenues in theſe countries is by the goodneſſe of God transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſuch uſes, which are indeed godly, to wit, to nouriſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, the poore, and Schollers, to erect Schooles, and to relieve Hoſpitals: that which remaineth is beſtowed in every Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie upon the guiding and ordering of things pertaining to their houſes: and to think that this is not very ſumptuous, it is but fooliſhneſſe.

                     <head>Hitherto alſo pertaineth the 16 Art. ſſ. 2. Of Prayer.</head>
                     <p>BY Prayer God is invocated, and true invocation is a worke of faith, and cannot be done without faith. Now faith doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt, and relie upon his merits onely. Wherefore, except thou ſhalt apply unto thy ſelfe the merit of Chriſt by faith, prayer will ſtand thee in no ſtead before God. Now prayer is neceſſarily required for this purpoſe, that by a due conſideration of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, faith may be ſtirred up and kindled in us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not abſurdly ſaid, that <hi>ſins are cleane taken away by prayer:</hi> yet muſt it not ſo be underſtood, as though the very worke of prayer, of it own merit, were a ſatisfaction for ſins before God; but that by prayer faith is ſtirred up and kindled in us, by which faith we are made partakers of the merit of Chriſt, and have our ſinnes forgiven us, onely for Chriſt his ſake. For before that we doe by prayer invocate God, it ſhall be neceſſarie, to have the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt applied to us, and received by faith. Therefore it cannot be, that prayer ſhould be ſuch a worke, as that for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thereof we might obtaine remiſſion of our ſins before God. Pſalme 108. <hi>Let his prayer be turned into ſinne.</hi> But it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that prayer ſhould be turned into ſinne, if of it ſelfe it were ſo worthy a worke, as that ſinne thereby ſhould be purged, <hi>Iſa. 1. When you ſhall ſtretch out your hands, I will turne my eyes from you: and when you ſhall multiply your prayers, I will not heare you.</hi> But God would not turne away his eyes from prayer, if of it owne worthineſſe it were a ſatisfaction for our ſins. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon the 108. Pſal. ſaith: <hi>That prayer which is not made through Chriſt, doth not onely not take away ſinne, but alſo it ſelfe is made ſin.</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <hi>de Quadrageſ. Ser.</hi> 5. ſaith: <hi>But ſome peradventure doe ſeeke eternall life, not in humilitie, but as it were in confidence of their own merits. Neither doe I ſay this, let grace received give a man confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to pray: but no man ought to put his confidence in his prayer, as though for his prayer he ſhould obtaine that which he deſireth. The gifts which are promiſed doe onely give this unto us, that we may hope to obtain even greater things, of that mercie which giveth theſe. Therefore let that prayer, which is made for temporall things, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in theſe wants onely: alſo let that prayer, which is made for the vertues of the ſoul, be free from all filthy, and uncleane behaviour:
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61072:201"/> and let that prayer, which is made for life eternall, be occupied about the onely good pleaſure of God, and that in all humilitie, preſuming, as is requiſite, of the onely mercie of God.</hi>

                     <head>Of Almes. <hi>CHAP. 18.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>VVE do diligently commend almes, and exhort the Church, that every man help his neighbour, by every dutie that he may, and teſtifie his love. But whereas it is ſaid in a certaine place, <hi>That almes doe take away ſinne, as water doth quench fire,</hi> we muſt underſtand it according to the analogie of faith. For what need was there, to the taking away of our ſins, of Chriſt his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and death, if ſins might be taken away by the merit of almes? And what uſe were there of the miniſterie of the Goſpell, if almes were appointed of God for an inſtrument, whereby the death of Chriſt might be applied to us? Therefore, that Chriſt his honour may not be violated, and the miniſterie of the Goſpell may retaine it lawfull uſe, we teach, that almes doth thus take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſinne, not that of it ſelfe it is a worthy worke, whereby ſinne may either be purged, or the merit of Chriſt applied, but that it is a worke and fruit of charitie toward our neighbour, by which worke we doe teſtifie our faith and obedience, which we owe unto God. Now where faith is, there Chriſt alone is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the purger of ſinnes. Therefore, ſeeing that almes doth teſtifie, after their manner, that Chriſt doth dwell in the godly, it doth alſo teſtifie that they have remiſſion of ſinnes. For except almes be a worke of charitie, which may beare witneſſe to faith in Chriſt, it is ſo farre from ſignifying, that man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins through Chriſt, that it doth even ſtinke in the ſight of God. <hi>If I ſhall diſtribute</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) all my ſubſtance, that it may be meat for the poore, and ſhall not have love, it profiteth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Therefore we teach, that good works muſt be done ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, that God is to be invocated, and that almes is to be given, that we may teſtifie our faith and love, and obey the calling of God. But in true repentance, we teach, that we obtaine remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, onely for the Son of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, through faith, according to that which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>To him doe all the Prophets beare witneſſe, that through his name, every one that beleeveth in him doth receive remiſsion of ſins.</hi>

                        <hi>AVguſtine</hi> writeth in a certaine place, <hi>that</hi> Ambroſe <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Millane, did ordaine, that the aſſemblies of the Church ſhould ſing Pſalmes, whereby they might mutually comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whileſt they looked for adverſitie, and ſtirre up themſelves to beare the croſſe: leſt the people, ſaith he, ſhould pine away with the yrkeſomneſſe of mourning.</hi> This ſinging, becauſe it was uſed in a tongue commonly known, it had both a godly uſe, and deſerved great praiſe. And by the Canonicall decree it appeareth, that thoſe houres, which they call Canonicall, were an appointment of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine times, wherein the whole holy Scripture ſhould be publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over-run every yeere, as in the ſchooles there be certaine hours appointed for interpreting of authors. Such a diſtribution of houres was peradventure not unprofitable for that time, and in it ſelfe it is not a thing to be condemned. But to appoint a ſpeciall kinde of prieſts, to chaunt but thoſe Canonicall hours, and to ſing them in a ſtrange tongue, which commonly is not known to the Church, or is not our countrey tongue, and that in ſome place in the night, and in the day time without any intermiſſion, new ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers very often taking one anothers courſe, and to make hereof a worſhip, not to this end, that by patience, and the comfort of the Scripture we might have hope, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, but that by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this worke a man might mitigate the wrath of God, and purge the ſinnes of men before God; this is it that is contrary to the meaning of that Church, which is indeed Catholique. 1 <hi>Cor. 14.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now that which was ſpoken, touching the uſe of a tongue that is commonly knowne, it muſt be underſtood not, only of the ſinging of Pſalmes, but alſo of all the parts of Eccleſiaſticall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie. For as Sermons and prayers are to be made, in a well knowne tongue to the Church, ſo alſo muſt the Sacraments be
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61072:202"/> diſpenſed in a ſpeech that is knowne. For, although it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at ſome time to uſe a ſtrange tongue, by reaſon of the learned, yet the conſent of the Catholike Church doth require this, that the neceſſarie miniſteries of the Church be executed in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſpeech, 1 <hi>Cor. 14.

                  <p>ANd for that cauſe, to wit, that men ſhould not winke at that offending of God, which might be committed under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his ſervice, then which nothing can offend him more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly, our Miniſters have condemned the moſt of thoſe things, which were uſed in the ſingings and prayers of Eccleſiaſticall men. For it is too too manifeſt that theſe have degenerated from the firſt appointment and uſe of the Fathers. For no man, which underſtandeth the writings of the ancient Fathers, is ignorant of this, that it was a cuſtome among them, wiſely to rehearſe, alſo to expound a few Pſalmes with ſome Chapter of the Scripture, whereas now adaies many Pſalmes are chaunted, for the moſt part without underſtanding, and of the reading of the Scripture, there be onely the beginnings of Chapters left unto us, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable things are taken up one after another, which ſerve rather
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61072:203"/> for ſuperſtition, then for godlineſſe. Therefore our Miniſters did firſt of all deteſt this, that many things, which were contrary to the Scriptures, are mingled with holy prayers and ſongs: as that thoſe things are attributed to Saints, which are proper to Chriſt alone; namely to free us from ſinne, and other diſcommodities, and not ſo much to obtaine, as to give us the favour of God, and all kinde of good things. Secondly, becauſe they are increaſed ſo infinitely, that they cannot be ſung, or rehearſed with an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive minde. Now it is nothing but a mocking of God, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we doe in his ſervice without underſtanding. Laſtly, becauſe that theſe things alſo were made meritorious works, and to be ſold for no ſmall price, that we may ſay nothing hereof, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the expreſſe commandement of the holy Ghoſt, all things are there ſaid and ſung in that tongue which not onely the people doth not underſtand, but many times alſo, not they themſelves, which doe live of thoſe kindes of ſinging and prayers.</p>

Every Church therefore doth chooſe unto it ſelfe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time, for publique prayers, and for preaching of the Goſpell, and for the celebration of the Sacraments: and it
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:61072:203"/> is not lawfull for every one to over throw this appointment of the Church at his own pleaſure. For except ſome due time and leiſure were allotted to the outward exerciſe of religion, out of doubt men would be quite drawn from it by their own affaires. In regard hereof we ſee that in the ancient Churches, there were not onely certaine ſet houres in the weeke appointed for meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but that alſo even the Lords day, ever ſince the Apoſtles time, was conſecrated to the religious exerciſes, and unto a holy reſt, which alſo is now very well obſerved of our Churches, for the worſhip of God, and increaſe of charitie. Yet herein we give no place unto the Iewiſh obſervation of the day, or to any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions. For we doe not account one day to be holier then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor thinke that reſting of it ſelfe is liked of God. Beſides we doc celebrate and keepe the Lords day, and not the Sabbath, and that with a free obſervation.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if the Churches doe religiouſly celebrate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the Lords nativitie, circumciſion, paſſion and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of his aſcenſion into heaven, and ſending the holy Ghoſt upon his Diſciples, according to Chriſtian libertie, we doe very well allow of it. But as for feſtivall dayes ordained to men, or the Saints departed, we cannot allow of them. For indeed ſuch feaſts, muſt be referred to the firſt Table of the Law, and belong pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly unto God. To conclude, theſe feſtivall dayes which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Saints, and abrogated of us, have in them many groſſe things, unprofitable, and not to be tolerated. In the meane time we confeſſe, that the remembrance of Saints, in due time and place, may be to good uſe and profit commended unto the people in Sermons, and the holy examples of holy men ſet before their eyes, to be imitated of all.</p>
                     <p>Now, the more ſharply that the Church of Chriſt doth accuſe ſurfeiting, drunkenneſſe, all kinde of luſts and intemperancie, ſo much the more earneſtly it doth commend unto us Chriſtian faſting. For faſting is nothing elſe but an abſtaining and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancie of the godly, and a watching and chaſtiſing of our fleſh, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up for the preſent neceſſitie, whereby we are humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and withdraw from the fleſh thoſe things, whereby it is cheriſhed, to the end it may the more willingly and eaſily obey the ſpirit. Wherefore they doe not faſt at all, that have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thoſe things, but doe imagine that they faſt, if they ſtuffe their bellies on a day, and for a ſet or preſcribed time doe
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:61072:204"/> abſtaine from certaine meats, thinking that by this very worke wrought they ſhall pleaſe God, and doe a good worke. Faſting is a helpe of the prayers of the Saints, and of all vertues. But the Faſts, wherein the Iews faſted from meat, and not from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, pleaſed God nothing at all, as we may ſee in the booke of the Prophets.</p>
                     <p>Now faſting is either publike or private. In old time they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated publike faſts in troubleſome times, and in the affliction of the Church. Wherein they abſtained altogether from meat unto the evening, and beſtowed all that time in holy prayers, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and repentance. Theſe differed little from mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and lamentations, and of theſe there is often mention made in the Prophets, and eſpecially in the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Ioel.</hi> Such a faſt ſhould be kept at this day, when the Church is in diſtreſſe. Private faſts are uſed of every one of us, according as every one feeleth the ſpirit weakned in him. For ſo farre forth he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth that which might cheriſh and ſtrengthen the fleſh. All faſts ought to proceed from a free and willing ſpirit, and ſuch a one as is truly humbled, and not framed to win applauſe and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of men, much leſſe to the end that a man might merit righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe by them. But let every one faſt to this end, that he may deprive the fleſh of that which would cheriſh it, and that he may the more zealouſly ſerve God.</p>
                     <p>The faſt of Lent hath teſtimonie of antiquitie, but none out of the Apoſtles writings: and therefore ought not nor cannot be impoſed on the faithfull.

                     <head>Of the buriall of the faithfull, and of the care which is to be had for ſuch as are dead, of purgatorie, and the appearing of ſpirits.</head>
                     <p>THe Scripture willeth that the bodies of the faithfull, as being temples of the holy Ghoſt, which we truly beleeve ſhall riſe againe at the laſt Day, ſhould be honeſtly without any ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion committed to the earth, and beſides that we ſhould make honourable mention of them which have godlily died in the Lord, and performe all duties of love to ſuch as they leave behind them, as their widows and fatherleſſe children. Other care to be taken for the dead, we teach none. Therefore we doe greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Cynikes, who neglected the bodies of the dead, or did very careleſly and diſdainfully caſt them into the earth, never ſpake ſo much as a good word of the dead, nor any whit regarded thoſe whom they left behinde them. Again, we condemne thoſe which are too much and prepoſterouſly officious toward the dead, who like Ethnikes doe greatly lament and bewaile their dead (we doe not diſcommend that moderate mourning, which the Apoſtle doth allow, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. but judge it an unnaturall thing, to be touched with no ſorrow) and do ſacrifice for the dead, and mumble certaine prayers, not without their penny for their paines, thinking by theſe their duties, to deliver theſe their friends from torments, wherein they being wrapped by death, they ſuppoſe they may be rid out of them againe by ſuch lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſongs. For we beleeve, that the faithfull, after the bodily death, doe goe directly unto Chriſt, and therefore doe not ſtand in need of the helpe or prayers for the dead, or any other ſuch dutie of them which are alive. In like manner we beleeve, that the unbeleevers be caſt headlong directly into hell, from whence there is no returne opened to the wicked, by any duties of thoſe which live.</p>

Theſe perſwaſions have brought forth many diſcommodities. Firſt the doctrine of the Goſpell is
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:61072:208"/> hereby obſcured, which teacheth, that ſins are forgiven freely by Chriſt. This benefit of Chriſt is transferred unto the worke of man. And by reaſon of this opinion, traditions were eſpecially encreaſed, becauſe that theſe works were ſuppoſed to deſerve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, to be ſatisfactions, and to be Chriſtian righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Moreover, for this cauſe eſpecially doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo often, and ſo earneſtly give us warning, to <hi>beware of traditions,</hi> leſt that Chriſts benefit ſhould be transferred to traditions, leſt the glory of Chriſt ſhould be obſcured, leſt that true and found comfort ſhould be withheld from mens conſciences, and in a word, leſt that faith, that is, truſt of the mercie of Chriſt, ſhould be quite ſmothered. Theſe dangers Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would have avoided. For it is greatly needfull that the pure doctrin of the benefit of Chriſt, of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and of the comfort of conſciences, ſhould be continued in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, theſe traditions have obſcured the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God: for this kinde of ſchooling was thought to be ſpirituall, and the righteouſneſſe of a Chriſtian man. Yea, the traditions of men were ſet aloft above the commandements of God. All Chriſtianitie was placed in the obſervation of certaine feſtivall dayes, rites, faſts, and forme of apparell. Theſe begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rudiments carried goodly titles, namely, that they were the ſpirituall life, and the perfection of a Chriſtian. In the meane while, the commandements of God touching every calling were of ſmall eſtimation: that the Father brought up his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that the Mother bare them, that the Prince governed the Common-wealth, theſe works were little ſet by. They were not taken to be any ſervice of God. The mindes of many ſtood in a continuall mamering, whether marriage, magiſtracie, and ſuch like functions of a civill life, did pleaſe God or no. And this doubtfulneſſe did trouble many very much, Many forſaking their callings, leaving the Common-wealth, did ſhut up themſelves in Monaſteries, that they might ſeeke that kinde of life, which they thought did more pleaſe God, yea which they ſuppoſed, to merit remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the opinion of neceſſitie did much vexe and diſquiet the conſciences. Traditions were thought neceſſary. And yet no man, though never ſo diligent, did ever obſerve them all, eſpecially for that the number of them was infinite. <hi>Gerſon</hi> writeth, <hi>That many fell into deſperation, ſome murthered themſelves, becauſe they
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:61072:208"/> perceived well, that they could not obſerve the traditions.</hi> And all this while they never heard one comfortable word of grace and of the righteouſneſſe of faith.</p>
                     <p>We ſee that the Summiſts and Divines gather together the<note place="margin">All this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and traditions in generall doth properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the 17. Section next following: but for as much as here is intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of daies, meats, &amp; faſts, it was requiſite that it ſhould be brought in this Section becauſe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals cannot well be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</note> traditions, and ſeeke out qualifications of them, for the unburden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mens conſciences: but even they cannot ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor winde themſelves out: and ſometimes alſo their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry interpretations themſelves doe ſnare mens conſciences. The Schooles alſo and Pulpits were ſo buſied in numbring up the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that they had no leaſure to handle the Scripture, or to ſearch out more profitable doctrine of faith, of the Croſſe, of Hope, of the excellencie of civill affairs, or of the comfort of mens conſciences in ſore tentations. Wherefore many good men have oft complained, that they were hindered by theſe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about traditions, that they could not be occupied in ſome better kinde of doctrine. When as therefore ſuch ſuperſtitious opinions did cleave faſt unto the traditions, it was neceſſary to admoniſh the Churches, what they were to judge of traditions, to free godly mindes from errour, to cure wounded conſciences, and to ſet out the benefit of Chriſt. We doe not goe about to weaken the authoritie of Eccleſiaſticall power, we detract no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3 &amp; 4 Obſerv. upon this confeſſion. in the 11. Sect.</note> dignitie of Biſhops: we doe not diſturbe the good order of the Church. Traditions rightly taken, are better liked: but we reprove thoſe Iewiſh opinions onely.</p>
                     <p>Thus therefore we teach, touching ceremonies brought into the Church by mans authoritie. Firſt, touching traditions, which are oppoſed to the commandement of God, or cannot be kept without ſinne, the Apoſtles rule is to be followed: <hi>We muſt obey God rather then men.</hi> Of this ſort is the tradition of ſingle life. Secondly, touching other ceremonies, which are in their owne nature things indifferent, as Faſts, Feſtivall daies, difference of apparell, and the like, we muſt know that ſuch obſervations doe neither merit remiſſion of ſinnes, neither yet are they the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe or perfection of a Chriſtian, but that they are things indifferent, which where is no danger of giving offence, may well be omitted.</p>
                     <p>This judgement of ours hath theſe evident and cleere teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Goſpel, to the end that it may admoniſh the Church, that the Goſpel be not oppreſſed and obſcured by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious opinions. <hi>Rom. 14. The kingdome of God is not meat and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:61072:209"/> drinke, but righteouſneſſe, peace, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Here <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth plainly, that a Chriſtians righteouſneſſe is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall motions of the heart, and not the outward obſervation of meates and daies, &amp;c. <hi>Coloſſ. 2. Let no man iudge you in meat, drinke, or a part of a holyday.</hi> He forbiddeth that their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſhould be judged, that is, that their conſciences ſhould be condemned in the uſe of ſuch things: but will have them coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted altogether indifferent things, and ſuch as pertaine not to the righteouſneſſe of the Goſpel. Then there followeth a long and a weightie ſpeech, both of the rites of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies appointed by the authoritie of man. For <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh namely of both kindes, denying them to be the righteouſneſſe of a Chriſtian, and forbidding to burden the conſciences with ſuch traditions. <hi>If ye be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the world: why, as though ye lived in the world, are ye burdened with traditions? Touch not, taſte not, handle not.</hi> Matt. 15. <hi>All that entereth into the mouth, defileth not the man,</hi> And in that place Chriſt excuſeth his Diſciples, that had broken a tradition, that was in uſe among them, and he addeth a notable ſaying, <hi>They worſhip me in vaine with the commandements of men.</hi> He denieth mans precepts to be true duties availeable unto righteouſneſſe before God. Wherefore they are not the righteouſneſſe of a Chriſtian, nor yet neceſſarie duties.</p>
                     <p>Yet for all that, it is apparant, how wonderfully the ſervices invented by man have multiplied and increaſed in the Church unto this day. The Monks did daily heape up ceremonies both with new ſuperſtitions, and alſo with new waies to bring in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And theſe trifles were thought to be the chiefeſt worſhip of God, and the greateſt godlineſſe, whereas Chriſt doth by a moſt grave and weightie Oracle forbid, that ſuch ceremonies ſhould be accounted for ſervices of God. For he doth not forbid the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of traditions unto a civill end and uſe, that is, for good orders ſake, but he denieth that any ſuch be any worſhip of God, in ſaying, <hi>In vaine doe they worſhip me.</hi> And he teacheth that true worſhips be workes commanded of God, as feare, faith, love, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, chaſtitie, walking in ones calling, doing of ones dutie, &amp;c. <hi>Acts 15. Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Why doe ye tempt God, laying a yoke on the Diſciples necke, which neither we, nor our Fathers were able to beare? but by the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt we beleeve to be ſaved, as doe alſo they.</hi> Here <hi>Peter</hi> ſheweth, that remiſſion of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:61072:209"/> ſinnes and ſalvation cometh to us by Chriſt and not by the rites of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the law; and doth alſo give us to underſtand, that ſuch doe grievouſly ſinne, which doe burden mens conſciences with ſuch ordinances. For it is no ſlight reproofe, when he ſaith, <hi>Why tempt ye God?</hi> And, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. He termeth the forbidding of of meats, mariages, and ſuch like traditions, <hi>doctrines of Devils.</hi> But why doth he uſe ſuch a ſharpe ſpeech? His meaning was not that there ſhould be no ordinances at all, or that no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of places and times ſhould be obſerved: but then he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth them to be doctrines of Devils, when as the benefit of Chriſt is attributed unto them, when they are reputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and for neceſſarie ſervices of God, when an opinion of neceſſitie is faſtened to them, and mens conſciences are racked, and faith made of no force by them. Theſe diſcommodities Chriſt and his Apoſtles would have to be diligently avoided, and for that cauſe they cry out ſo often, and ſo earneſtly againſt tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And it is a wonder, that the patrons of ſuch ſuperſtitious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions about traditions, are no whit moved with ſuch thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeeches.</p>
                     <p>Now as for us, we teach that thoſe traditions are not to bee condemned, which command nothing againſt the laws of God, and have a civill uſe and end, namely, ſuch as are ordained to this end, that things might be done orderly in the Church. Of which ſort are the traditions about holy dayes, the Lords day, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, Paſſeover, and the reſt: alſo about the holy readings and leſſons, and ſuch like. Now all rites of this kinde we retaine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly in our Churches. And yet the Church is taught, to know, what to thinke of ſuch cuſtomes, to wit, that they doe not merit remiſſion of ſinnes, that they are not the righteouſneſſe of a Chriſtian, nor neceſſary duties unto Chriſtian righteouſneſſe, but indifferent things, which a man may omit, where there is no danger of giving offence. This qualifying of traditions doth ſet free the conſciences from ſuperſtitious opinions, and from that old torture and racking. And yet it bringeth great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to traditions, becauſe it ſheweth the true uſe of them. All modeſt men will more willingly obey the traditions, after they underſtand that their conſciences are ſet free from danger in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and that they muſt ſo far obey, as that the common peace be not diſturbed, nor the weake ones hurt. Againe, this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth defend and preſerve publique good manners and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:61072:210"/> becauſe it commandeth to avoid offences. Alſo to obſerve publike holy dayes, the meetings in the Churches, readings, &amp;c. doe ſerve for examples, and to accuſtome the youth, and the common ſort thereto. Therefore ſuch ordinances are not to be broken, but rather with common care and travell to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
                     <p>Theſe be the true and meet commendations of traditions, which no doubt doe greatly ſtirre up ſuch as are godly and ſtaied, to love, defend, and adorne the publike orders. The Goſpel teacheth to thinke reverently, not onely of other civill laws and orders, but alſo of Eccleſiaſticall, and ſeeketh the true uſe of them. Yet notwithſtanding it appointeth degrees, and will have the doctrine touching Chriſt, and things that are heavenly and everlaſting, diſcerned from the ſchooling, or Pedagogie of the Church. This libertie, whereof we ſpeake now, was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the Fathers. For <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>This whole kinde of things hath free obſervations;</hi> and to this purpoſe he diſcourſeth at large. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, <hi>The diſagreement in faſting doth not break off the agreement in faith.</hi> The Tripartite hiſtory gathereth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many examples of rites diſagreeing one from the other, and in the end addeth a notable ſaying, <hi>It was not the Apoſtles mind, to preſcribe any thing touching holy dayes, but to preach godlineſſe, and a good converſation.</hi> But in ſo manifeſt a matter, it is needles to heape up many teſtimonies.</p>
                     <p>But our adverſaries doe here make great outcries, <hi>That by this doctrine publike diſcipline and order is overthrowne, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and anarchie brought in. Likewiſe, that good workes and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the fleſh are aboliſhed, according to Jovinians ſurmiſe.</hi> Theſe ſlanders we have partly refuted already: there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion or anarchie brought in, nor the publique diſcipline over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, when as we teach, that traditions, which have a civill end and uſe, ought to be obſerved. And we teach alſo that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt be foreſeene and avoided. But touching mortification, we anſwer thus: True and unfeigned mortification is to beare the croſſe, to indure dangers, troubles, and afflictions. This kind of obedience is the worſhip of God, and a ſpirituall worke, as the <hi>Pſalme</hi> teacheth: <hi>A ſacrifice to God is a troubled ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> We teach moreover that another kinde of exerciſe is neceſſarie. It is the dutie of every Chriſtian to bridle his fleſh, even by bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcipline, labours, temperancie, meditation of heavenly things,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61072:210"/> and ſuch other exerciſes, fit for his age. The neereſt and proper end whereof muſt be this, that fulneſſe and idleneſſe doe not pricke him forward to ſinne, and that his minde may be ſtirred up, and made more apt for heavenly affections. It is not to bee thought, that theſe exerciſes are a worſhip of God, that deſerve remiſſion of ſinnes, or that they be ſatisfactions, &amp;c. And this diſcipline muſt be continuall: neither can certain dayes be ſet and appointed equally for all. Of this diſcipline Chriſt ſpeaketh: <hi>Beware that your bodies be not oppreſſed with ſurfet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, theſe exerciſes, when as they are referred unto that end, that we may have our bodies fit for ſpirituall things, and to doe our duties, according to a mans calling, &amp;c. they are good in the godly, and <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1.

                     <p>IT hath beene a common opinion, not of the common ſort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but alſo of ſuch as are teachers in the Churches, that the differences of meates, and ſuch like humane traditions, are works available to merit remiſſion both of the fault, and of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that the world thus thought, it is apparant by this, that daily new ceremonies, new orders, new holy dayes, new faſts, were appointed: and the teachers in the Churches, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act theſe workse, at the peoples hands, as a ſervice neceſſary to deſerve juſtification by, and they did greatly terrifie their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, if ought were omitted. * Of this perſwaſion of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions many diſcommodities have followed in the Church. For firſt the doctrine of grace, is obſcured by it, &amp; alſo the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, which is the moſt eſpeciall point of the Goſpel, and which it behoveth moſt of all to be extant, and to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence in the Church, that the merit of Chriſt may be well
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:61072:211"/> known, and faith, which beleeveth that ſinnes are remitted through Chriſt, and not for any works of ours, may be exalted farre above works. For which cauſe alſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> laboureth much in this point: he removeth the law and humane traditions, that he may ſhew that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is a farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, then ſuch workes as theſe be, namely, a faith, which beleeveth that ſins are freely remitted through Chriſt. But this doctrine of S. <hi>Paul</hi> is almoſt wholly ſmothered by traditions, which have bred an opinion, that by making difference in meats and ſuch like ſervices, a man muſt merit remiſſion of ſinnes and juſtification. In their doctrine of repentance there was no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith: onely theſe ſatisfactory works were ſpoken of: Repentance ſeemed to ſtand wholly in theſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, theſe traditions obſcured the Commandements of God, that they could not be knowne, becauſe that traditions were preferred farre above the Commandements of God. All Chriſtianitie was thought to be an obſervation of certaine holy dayes, rites, faſts, and attire. Theſe obſervations carried a goodly title and name, that they were the ſpirituall life, and the perfect life. In the meane ſeaſon Gods Commandements touching e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans calling, were of ſmall eſtimation. That the father brought up his children, that the mother bare them, that the Prince governed the common wealth, theſe were reputed worldly affaires, and unperfect and farre inferiour to thoſe gliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſervations and orders. And theſe errors did greatly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment good mindes, which were grieved that they were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted to an unperfect kinde of life, in marriage, in Magiſtracie, and in other civill functions. They had the Monks and ſuch like men in admiration, and falſely imagined, that their orders did more deſerve remiſſion of ſinnes and juſtification.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, traditions brought great danger to mens conſciences, becauſe it was impoſſible to keep them all, and yet men thought the obſervation of them to be neceſſarie duties. <hi>Gerſon</hi> writeth, that many fell into deſpaire, and ſome murdered themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they perceived that they could not keepe the traditions: and all this while they never heard the comfort of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, or of grace. We ſee the Summiſts and Divines ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together the traditions, and ſeeke qualifications of them, to unburden mens conſciences: and yet all will not ſerve, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they bring more ſnares upon the conſcience. The Schooles
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:61072:211"/> and Pulpits have beene ſo buſied in gathering together the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that they had not leaſure once to touch the Scripture, and to ſeeke out a more profitable doctrine, of faith, of the Croſſe, of hope, of the dignitie of civill affaires, of the comfort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in perilous aſſaults. Wherefore <hi>Gerſon</hi> and ſome other Divines have made grievous complaints that they were hindered by braules about traditions, that they could not be occupied in ſome better kinde of doctrine. And Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> forbiddeth that mens conſciences ſhould be burdened with ſuch kinde of obſervations, and doth very wiſely warne <hi>Januarius</hi> to know, that they are to be obſerved indifferently: for he ſo ſpeaketh: <hi>Wherefore our Miniſters muſt not be thought, to have touched this matter unadviſedly, for hatred of the Biſhops, as ſome doe falſely ſurmiſe. There was great need to admoniſh the Churches of thoſe errors, which did ariſe from miſtaking of traditions: for the Goſpel driveth men to urge the doctrine of grace, and the of righteouſnes of faith, in the Church: which yet can never be underſtood, if men ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they can merit remiſſion of ſinnes, and iuſtification, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their owne choice.</hi> Thus therefore they have taught us, that we can never merit remiſſion of ſinnes and juſtification, by the obſervation of mans traditions: and therefore that we muſt not thinke, that ſuch obſervations are neceſſarie duties. Hereunto they adde teſtimonies out of the Scriptures. Chriſt excuſeth his diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. which kept not the received tradition, which yet ſeemed to be about a matter not unlawfull, but indifferent, and to have ſome affinitie with the waſhings of the law, and ſaith, <hi>They worſhip me in vaine with the precepts of men.</hi> Chriſt therefore requireth no unprofitable worſhip: and a little after, he addeth, <hi>All that entereth in at the mouth defileth not the man.</hi> Againe, <hi>Rom. 14. The kingdome of God is not meat and drinke.</hi> Col. 2. <hi>Let no man iudge you in meat, or drinke, in a Sabbath, or in an holy day.</hi> Againe, <hi>If ye be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the world, why, as though ye lived in the world, are ye burdened with traditions, Touch not, taſte not, handle not?</hi> Act. 15. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Why tempt ye God, laying a yoke upon the necks of the diſciples, which neither we, nor our fathers were able to beare? but by the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, we hope to be ſaved, as did alſo they.</hi> Here <hi>Peter</hi> forbiddeth to burden the conſciences with many rites, whether they be of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of any others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing: and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. he calleth the forbidding of meats, <hi>a
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61072:212"/> doctrine of devils:</hi> becauſe that it is flat againſt the Goſpel, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point or doe ſuch workes, to the end that by them we may merit remiſſion of ſinnes or juſtification, or becauſe that there could be no Chriſtianitie without them.</p>
                     <p>Here our adverſaries object againſt us, <hi>that our Miniſters hinder all good diſcipline and mortification of the fleſh, as</hi> lovinian <hi>did.</hi> But the contrary may be ſeene by our mens writings. For they have alwaies taught, touching the Croſſe, that Chriſtians muſt ſuffer afflictions. This is the true, earneſt, and unfeigned mortification, to be exerciſed with divers afflictions, and to be crucified with Chriſt. Moreover they teach, that every Chriſtian muſt ſo by bodily diſcipline, or bodily exerciſes and labour, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and keepe under himſelfe, that fulneſſe and ſloth do not prick him up to ſinne, not that he may by ſuch exerciſes merit ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the fault, or of eternall death: and this corporall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline muſt alwaies be plied, not onely to a few, and thoſe ſet dayes, according to the commandement of Chriſt, <hi>Take heed that your bodies be not oppreſſed with ſurfetting.</hi> Againe, <hi>This kinde of devill is not caſt out but by faſting and prayer:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I chaſtiſe my body, and bring it under ſubiection.</hi> Where he plainly ſheweth, that he did therefore chaſtiſe his body, not that by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline hee might merit remiſſion of ſinnes, but that his body might be apt, and fit for ſpirituall things, and to do his duty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his calling. Therefore we doe not condemne faſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but the traditions, which preſcribe certaine daies and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meates, with danger to the conſciences, as though ſuch workes as theſe were neceſſary duties.</p>
                     <p>Yet many of the traditions are obſerved among us, which tend unto this end, that things may be done orderly in the Church, as namely the <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> order of leſſons in the Maſſe, and the chiefeſt holy dayes. But in the meane time men are admoniſhed, that ſuch a ſervice doth not juſtifie before God, and that there is no ſinne to be put in ſuch things, if they be left undone, ſo it be without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. This libertie in humane rites and ceremonies was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the fathers. For in the Eaſt Church they kept Eaſter at another time then they did in Rome: and when as they of the Church of Rome accuſed the Eaſt Church of Schiſme for this diverſitie, they were admoniſhed by others, that ſuch faſhions ſhould not be alike every where. And <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſaith: <hi>The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement about facting doth not breake off the agreement of faith.</hi>
                        <pb n="385" facs="tcp:61072:212"/> Beſides, Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> in the 12. diſtinction inſinuateth, that ſuch diverſitie doth not hurt the unitie of the Church: and in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite hiſtory <hi>lib.</hi> 9. many examples of different rites are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and theſe words are there rehearſed, <hi>The minde of the Apoſtles was, not to give precepts of holy daies, but to preach godlineſſe and a good converſation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is then to be thought of the Lords day, and of ſuch like rites uſed in Churches? Hereunto they anſwer, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Biſhops or Paſtors to appoint ordinances, whereby things may be done in order in the Church, not that by them we ſhould merit remiſſion of ſins, or ſatisfie for ſins, or that mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhould be bound to eſteeme them as neceſſarie ſervices, and think that they ſinne, when they violate any one of them, though it be without the offence of others. So <hi>Paul</hi> ordained, <hi>that women ſhould cover their heads in the congregation, that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of Scripture ſhould be heard in courſe or order in the church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such like ordinances it behoveth the Churches to keepe for charitie, and quietneſſe ſake, ſo farre forth, that one offend not another, that all things may be done in order, and without tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult in the Church: but yet with this caution, that mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be not burdened, ſo as they ſhould account them as things neceſſarie to ſalvation, and think they did ſin, when they brake any one of them without offence of others: as no man would ſay that a woman doth offend, if ſhe come abroad with her head uncovered, without the offence of any.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſort is the obſervation of the Lords day, of Eaſter, of Pentecoſt, and ſuch like holy dayes, and rites. For they that think, that the obſervation of the Lords day was appointed by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church inſtead of the Sabbath, as neceſſarie, they are greatly deceived. The Scripture requireth that the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſhould be now free: for it teacheth that the Moſaicall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are not needfull after the Goſpel is revealed. And yet becauſe it was requiſite to oppoint a certain day, that the people might know when to come together, it ſeemeth that the Church did for that purpoſe appoint the Lords day: which day for this cauſe alſo ſeemed to have better liked the Church, that in it men might have an example of Chriſtian libertie, and might know, that the obſervation, neither of the Sabbath, nor of any other day, was of neceſſitie.</p>
                     <p>There are extant certaine monſtrous diſputations touching
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61072:213"/> the changing of the law, and the ceremonies of the new law, and of the change of the Sabbath, which did all ſpring up of a falſe perſwaſion, that there ſhould be a worſhip in the Church, like to the Leviticall worſhip: and that Chriſt gave the charge of devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing new ceremonies, which ſhould be neceſſary to ſalvation, to the Apoſtles and Biſhops. Theſe errours crept into the Church, when as the doctrine of faith was not plainely enough taught. Some diſpute, that the obſervation of the Lords day is not indeed of the law of God, but as it were of the law of God: and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy days, they preſcribe, how far it is lawful to work in them. What elſe are ſuch diſputations, but ſnares for mens conſciences?</p>

                     <p>FAſting hath it praiſe and uſe. But now we doe not ſpeak ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of neceſſary faſting, when a man muſt needs faſt for want of meat, or of an allegoricall faſting, which is to abſtaine from all vices: but we are to ſpeak of two uſuall kindes of faſting, whereof the one is a perpetuall faſt, and this is a ſobrietie, which is alwaies to be kept, in meat and drink, throughout the whole courſe of a mans life: for it is never lawfull for us to ravine, and to follow ſurfetting, and drunkenneſſe. There is another faſt, which is for a day, when as ſometimes we abſtaine from meat the whole day, ſuch as was uſed in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. Alſo the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> of the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> and others, doe witneſſe the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:61072:214"/> ſame thing. This kinde of faſting was alſo uſed after the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, as appeareth, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 14. But afterward there followed a great difference in Churches touching the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch a kinde of faſting: and as this difference brought no diſcommoditie to the Church, ſo it teſtified, that the uſe of this faſting was free. And there is a worthy ſaying among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, touching this varietie: <hi>The difference,</hi> ſay they, <hi>of faſtings doth not breake off the agreement of faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now although ſome men doe thinke, that Chriſt by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did conſecrate, <hi>the faſt of Lent,</hi> yet it is manifeſt, that Chriſt did not command this faſt, neither can the conſtitution of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abide it, that we ſhould imitate the example of Chriſt his faſting, who did abſtaine full 40. dayes, and 40. nights, from all meat and drinke. Alſo <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth declare, and that not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, <hi>That the uſe of this Lenten faſt was very free in the Church.</hi> Moreover <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> in <hi>Gen. cap. 2. Hom.</hi> 11. ſaith, <hi>If thou canſt not faſt, yet thou maiſt abſtaine from ſinnes: and this is not the leaſt thing, nor much differing from faſting, but fit to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw even the fury of the Devill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither was there any choice of meats appointed, becauſe the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>To the cleane, all things are cleane.</hi> But in the obſervation of ſuch faſts, we muſt chiefely marke the end. The ancient fathers did ſomtimes faſt whole daies together, that they might give themſelves to publique prayer, and by this diſcipline might admoniſh their Church, &amp; eſpecially the youth of dangers that were paſt or preſent, or hanging over their heads, and might ſtir them up to repentance, whereby the wrath of God might be aſſwaged. This is the godly and profitable end of theſe faſtings.</p>
                     <p>Others doe faſt, <hi>That by the merit of this worke, they may purge their ſinnes before God, or,</hi> as ſome doe ſpeake, <hi>Apply unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the merit of Chriſt, by their faſting.</hi> But this end is utterly to be condemned. For firſt, the onely death of Chriſt is the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſinnes. Secondly, faſting was not ordained for this uſe, that it ſhould be a work, whereby, the merit of Chriſt may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us. For, faſting is either joyned with true repentance, and then the merit of Chriſt is applied to him that repenteth by faith, which is the chiefe part of repentance, before a man doth begin or end his faſting: or elſe faſting is without repentance, and then it is abominable in the ſight of God, ſo far is it from applying the merit of Chriſt to him that faſteth. <hi>Iſa. 58. Is it ſuch a fast
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:61072:214"/> that I have choſen, that a man ſhould afflict his ſoule for a day, and to bowe down his head as a bulruſh?</hi> Auguſtine <hi>Epiſt. 86. ad Caſula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I revolving that in my minde, which is writen in the Evangelicall and Apoſtolique Scriptures, and in that whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument which they call the New Teſtament, doe ſee that faſting is commanded. But on what dayes we ought not to faſt, and on what dayes, we ought to faſt, I doe not ſee it defined, either by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord, or of the Apoſtles. And by this I thinke, that rather a releaſing, then a binding to faſting, is the more fit and apt, not to obtaine righteouſneſſe, (wherein the beautie of the Kings daughter doth conſiſt inwardly) which is obtained by faith, but yet, to ſignifie a perpetuall reſt.</hi> And <hi>Chryſoſtom, Tom. 4. de Iejun. Quadrag. Hom.</hi> 73. ſaith: <hi>If we come daily hither, and faſt the whole Lent, and doe not change our life to the better, it will be an occaſion of our greater condemnation.</hi> By theſe teſtimonies it is evident, that it is neither Apoſtolique, not Catholique, to thinke that faſting is a work, whereby either ſinnes are purged before God, or the merit of Chriſt is applied.</p>

                     <head>Of the conſecrating of water, ſalt, wine, and other things.</head>
                     <p>VVE confeſſe, that the forbidding of water, whereby the Leviticall uncleannes was purged, was ordained of God in the Old Teſtament. Alſo we acknowledge that miracle wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Prophet <hi>Elizeus</hi> did heale the barren waters of <hi>Jericho,</hi> by caſting in of ſalt. And we embrace that, which <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be reiected, which is received with thankeſgiving: for it is ſanctified by the word of God, and by prayer.</hi> But wheras in the new Teſtament, water is conſecrated, which they call <hi>holy water,</hi> by the ſprinkling whereof veniall ſins are taken away, and Devils are driven away: and whereas ſalt alſo is conſecrated, to make things wholeſome, which otherwiſe be hurtfull, it ſeemeth neither to be Apoſtolike, nor Catholique. For we are not commanded by the word of God to imitate the Leviticall ſprinkling, or <hi>Eilezeus</hi> his miracle, but it was uſed by mans arbitrement and pleaſure: and therefore it appertaineth to this ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>In vaine doe they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the precepts of men.</hi> And it is evident that
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:61072:215"/> the ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt, which is made by the word of the Goſpel, by Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper, and received by ſaith, doth purge us from our ſinnes. That therefore which is proper to the blood of Chriſt, which by the ordinance of God was ſhed for our ſinnes, ought not to be attributed to water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by the appointment of man. And <hi>as touching that Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus did heale the barren waters by ſalt,</hi> there is a miracle ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, that thereby we may confirme that credit, which we ought to give to the preaching of the Prophet; but it is not ſet before us to be imitated without a ſpecial calling of God: becauſe the miracles of the Saints uſe not to be generall, but perſonall.</p>
                     <p>And as touching that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that creatures are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the word of God, and by prayer,</hi> he meaneth not that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as for example, ſalt, fleſh, egges, hearbs, are to be conjured, that Satan by the uſe of them may be driven away; but that all creatures are by the word of God every one appointed to their outward uſe, which then ſerve for our good, when we uſe them well, by faith, and praying unto God. So God created ſalt, to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon meat, and to preſerve fleſh from putrifying: he created wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to ſerve for drinke, or waſhing, or watering, and not to drive away the devil. Indeed in Baptiſme, he ordained <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. Obſervation upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of Saxonie, Sect. 13.</note> water to waſh away ſins: but this is not the generall end why water was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but a ſpeciall ordinance, appointed by a ſpeciall word of God. For, as touching the generall creation and ſanctification of God, there is no word of God, that doth witneſſe, that the creatures, which we before have rehearſed, by conjurings are made profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table hereunto, that they may take away ſinnes, and chaſe away the devils. Now that which is brought in without the word of God, to another uſe then God hath ordained it unto, it cannot be done in faith, but it becometh an abuſe, and doth rather bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, then ſalvation, <hi>Rom. 14.

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:61072:215"/> we confeſſe, that the Epiſtle, which beareth the name of <hi>Iames,</hi> doth command, <hi>that the Elders of the Church be called unto the ſicke, that they may anoint them with oyle, and pray for them, that they may obtaine health.</hi> But theſe things were then practiſed profitably, when as yet the Miniſters of the Church were indued with the gift of healing the ſicke corporally, and wonderfully. But after that this gift ceaſed, the Goſpel being confirmed in the Church, the thing it ſelfe doth witneſſe, that this ceremonie of anointing is now idlely, and unfruitfully uſed.

                     <p>ALthough indeed there is no difference, betweene a Saint reſting in Chriſt, and a faithfull man departed (for everie one which dieth in the faith of Chriſt, is a Saint) yet becauſe it hath pleaſed ſome to put a difference betwixt theſe two, we alſo thought it good to make two ſeverall Chapters thereof. And firſt, we thinke, that it belongeth to a godly minde, to made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent mention of his elders which have died in the faith of Chriſt, and to ſhew forth toward their poſteritie and friends which are alive, in all dutifull manner that we can, that thankfulneſſe, which is due to thoſe benefits, which we received of them. Secondly, faith requireth of us, that we doe not think that the dead are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that they doe indeed live before God: to wit, that the godly doe live bleſſedly in Chriſt: and that the wicked doe live in an horrible expectation of the revelation of the judgement of God. Alſo, charitie requireth, that we ſhould wiſh all peace and happineſſe to them that are dead in Chriſt. This alſo is to be
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:61072:216"/> added, that, to teſtifie the hope of our reſurrection, we muſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie our dead decently, ſo neere as may be, and as the time, and conditions of men will ſuffer. <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. Obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion.</note> Therefore we thinke it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable thing, that at burials thoſe things be rehearſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded out of the holy Scriptures, which do ſerve to ſtrengthen our faith in the horror of death, and to confirme our hope of the reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>But that the dead are helped by thoſe uſuall watchings, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſacrifices, and that by the merits thereof, they be either delivered from their paines, or obtaine a greater felicitie which is in heaven, there is no teſtimony out of that doctrine which is indeed Propheticall and Apoſtolicall. For there is one onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of eternall life, and we have one onely redemption and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; to wit, Paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is made ours, when we beleeve in Chriſt, and we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with it, when we doe not beleeve the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn 3. God ſent not his Sonne into the world, that he ſhould condemne the world, but that the world through him might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. He that beleeveth in him, ſhall not be condemned: but he that beleeveth not, is condemned already, becauſe he beleeveth not in the onely begotten Sonne of God.</hi> Therefore if any man ſhall depart out of this life in the faith of Chriſt, he hath a I the merit of Chriſt, and needeth none other. <hi>For God which gave his Sonne, doth alſo give all things with him,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. But he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth hence without Chriſt, cannot be helped by any merits of men, becauſe that without Chriſt there is no ſalvation. <hi>Cyprian</hi> againſt <hi>Demet. Tract.</hi> 1. ſaith: <hi>When a man is once departed hence, there is no place left for repentance, there is no effect of ſatisfaction: here life is either loſt, or held faſt: here we muſt provide for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation, by the ſervice or worſhip of God, and by the fruit of faith.</hi> And <hi>Hierome</hi> upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Gal.</hi> Chap. 6. ſaith: <hi>We are taught by this ſmall ſentence, though obſcurely, a new point of doctrine lyeth hid, to wit, that whileſt we be in this preſent world, we may help one another, either by prayers, or by counſell: but when we ſhall come before the tribunall ſeat of Chriſt, it is not Iob, nor Daniel, nor Noe, that can intreat any thing for us, but every man ſhall beare his owne burden.</hi> For, as touching that which is cited out of the <hi>Maccabees, That ſacrifices were offered for the ſinnes of the dead,</hi> the Authour himſelfe of the booke doth doubt, in the end of the booke, whether he hath written well, &amp;c. <hi>craveth

                     <p>ALthough we ought not to doubt, but that the Saints have their Purgatorie fire in this life, as the examples of <hi>David, Ezechias, Jonas,</hi> and others doe witneſſe, yet it is not without cauſe doubted, whether that after this life there be ſuch a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, as the common ſort of men do thinke there is, wherein the ſouls be ſo long tormented, till either by their puniſhment they doe ſatisfie for their ſins, or be redeemed by Indulgences. For if Purgatorie be ſuch a thing, it is much to be marvelled at, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prophets, nor the Apoſtles have in their writings deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto us any thing thereof certainly, and plainly, but rather doe teach, and that not obſcurely, the cleare contrary, <hi>Mark 16. Preach ye the Goſpell to every creature: he that ſhall beleeve, and be baptized, ſhall be ſaved: but he that will not beleeve ſhall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Here be two degrees of men placed: the one of them, which beleeve the Goſpell, and they are pronounced, <hi>ſaved:</hi> the other of them, which doe not beleeve the Goſpell, and theſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>condemned:</hi> there is no meane betwixt theſe two. For either thou doeſt depart out of this life in the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, and then thou haſt remiſſion of thy ſinnes for Chriſt his ſake, and the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is imputed to thee. Therefore he which dyeth, being accompanied with Chriſt, he wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing toward the obtaining of true and eternall life: but he which departeth from hence without Chriſt, goeth into eternall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>If beſide theſe two degrees there were ſome other third ſtate of ſouls in another world, certainly <hi>Paul, Who was taken up into
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:61072:217"/> Paradiſe, and into the third heaven, and ſaw many ſecret things,</hi> would not have envied the Church this knowledge. But ſee, when he doth of ſet purpoſe write to the Theſſalonians, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſtians that ſleepe, he maketh no mention at all of any Purgatorie, but rather willeth them, <hi>Not to be ſorrowfull, even as others which have no hope.</hi> Therefore if there were any ſuch ſtate of ſouls in another world, as the common people thinketh there is. <hi>Paul</hi> could not be withheld, but in ſo fit a place he would plainly have declared this ſtate of ſouls, and would have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a meane unto the Church, whereby miſerable ſouls might be delivered from their torment. But the true &amp; Catholike Church in deed, hath plainly ſhewed that ſhe hath no certaintie at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this third kinde of the ſtate of ſouls in another world. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his ſecond Sermon of Lazarus, ſaith. <hi>If thou haſt violently taken any thing from any man, reſtore it, and ſay, as doth</hi> Zacheus, <hi>If I have taken from any man by forged cavillation, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore fourefold. If thou art become an enemie to any man, be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before thou come to iudgement. Diſcharge all things here, that without griefe thou maiſt behold that tribunall ſeat. Whileſt we be here, we have many excellent hopes. But ſo ſoone as we depart thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is not then in our power to repent, nor to waſh away our ſins.</hi> And againe, <hi>He that in this preſent life ſhall not waſh away his ſins, ſhall not finde any comfort afterward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> although he place certaine men in the middeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, that be very good, and thoſe that be very evill, to the one ſort whereof he ſeemeth to aſſigne the place of Purgatorie, yet in other places he doubteth of that matter, and doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine any certaintie. Therefore we muſt ſo thinke of this opinion of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as he requireth, that is, we muſt receive that, which is confirmed, either by the authoritie of the Scripture, or by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſon. But it is evident, that thoſe places of the Scripture, which are commonly cited, to eſtabliſh Purgatorie, are wreſted from the naturall, to a ſtrange ſenſe, and are farre otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, even of the ancient Writers themſelves. And thoſe reaſons which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> bringeth for his opinion, doe ſeeme to leane to this foundation, <hi>That we obtaine remiſsion of our ſins and life, not onely for Chriſt his ſake, through faith, but alſo for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our works.</hi> But how this agreeth with the true Apoſtolike doctrine, we have before declared. Wherefore we thinke, that this ſpeculation of Purgatorie fire, is to be left to it own authors,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:61072:217"/> and that we muſt chiefly doe this, as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth us, that we may confirme our ſelves one another with ſpeeches touching the aſſured faith of our reſurrection, and ſalvation in Chriſt Ieſus, for whoſe ſake God doth ſo favour the faithfull, that in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of death he preſerveth them, and giveth them true peace.</p>

For true faſting is as it were a renouncing of this preſent life, which is alwaies ſubject to evill luſts and deſires, and a meditation of the life to come, which is free from all pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. And prayer is a lifting up of the minde unto God, and ſuch a familiar ſpeech with him, as no other thing can ſo greatly ſet a man on fire with heavenly affections, and more mightily make the minde comformable to the will of God. And though theſe exerciſes be never ſo holy, and neceſſary for Chriſtians, yet ſeeing that a mans neighbour is not ſo much benefited by them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> as man is prepared, that he may with fruit and profit have regard of his neighbour, they are not to be preferred before holy doctrin, godly exhortations and admonitions, and alſo other duties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our neighbour doth preſently receive ſome profit. Whereupon we reade of our Saviour, that in the night time he gave himſelfe to prayer, and in the day time to doctrine, and to heale the ſicke. For as love is greater then faith and hope, ſo to beleeve thoſe things, which come neereſt unto love, to wit, ſuch as bring aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red profit unto men, are to be preferred before all other holy fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: whereupon S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> writeth, that <hi>Among the</hi>

                     <p>BVt becauſe that no mindes, but theſe that be ardent, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly ſtirred up by the heavenly inſpiration, can either pray, or faſt aright, and with profit, we beleeve that it is farre better, after the example of the Apoſtles, and the former and more ſincere
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:61072:218"/> Church, by holy exhortations to invite men hereunto, then to wring them out by precepts, ſuch eſpecially, as do binde men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of deadly ſin: the which thing the Prieſts that were of late tooke upon them to doe, when as then the order of Prieſts had not a little degenerated. But we had rather leave the place, time, and manner, both of praying, and alſo of faſting, to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement of the holy Ghoſt, then to preſcribe them by certaine laws, eſpecially ſuch, as may not be broken without ſome ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of amends. Yet for their ſakes that be the younger, and more imperfect ſort, our Preachers doe not diſlike, that there ſhould be an appointed time and meanes, both for prayer, and alſo for faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as it were by theſe holy introductions to exerciſes they might be prepared hereunto, ſo that it be done, without binding of the conſcience. We were induced thus to thinke, not ſo much for that all compulſion being againſt a mans will, is repugnant to the nature of theſe actions, but rather, becauſe that neither Chriſt himſelfe, nor any of his Apoſtles, have in any place made mention of ſuch kinde of precepts: and this doth <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> alſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſaying: <hi>Thou ſeeſt that an upright life doth helpe more then all other things. Now I tearme an upright life not the labour of</hi>

                        <hi>Faſting, nor the bed of haire, or aſhes, but if thou doeſt deſpiſe money, no other wiſe then it becommeth thee, if thou burne with charitie, if thou nouriſh the hungry with thy bread, if thou overcome thy anger, if thou doeſt not deſire vain glory, if thou be not poſſeſſed with envie: for theſe be the things that he teacheth, for he doth not ſay, that he will have his faſt to be followed, howbeit, he might have proponed thoſe fortie dayes unto us: but he ſaith, Learne of me, becauſe I am meeke, and lowly in heart. Yea rather on the contrary ſide,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>eate all that is ſet before you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, we doe not read, that any ſolemne or ſet faſt was enjoyned to the ancient Church, but that faſt of one day. For thoſe faſts, which as the Scripture doth witneſſe, were ordained of Prophets, and of Kings, it is certaine, that they were no ſet faſts, but enjoyned onely for their time, to wit, when as evident cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, either hanging over their heads, or preſently pinching them, did ſo require it. Seeing therefore that the Scripture, as, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth affirme, doth inſtruct a man to every good work, and yet is ignorant of theſe faſts which are extorted by precepts, we doe not ſee, how it could be lawfull for the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, to overcharge the Church with ſo great and ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:61072:218"/> a burthen. Truly, <hi>Ireneus</hi> doth witneſſe, <hi>that in times paſt the obſervation of faſt in Churches was divers, and free,</hi> as it is read in the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, <hi>lib. 8. cap.</hi> 14. In the ſame booke <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> maketh mention, that one <hi>Apollonius,</hi> an Eccleſiaſticall Writer among other arguments uſed this for one, to confute the doctrine of <hi>Montanus</hi> the heretike, <hi>Becauſe he was the firſt that made lawes for faſts.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith in a certaine place, <hi>Faſting is good, but let no man be compelled thereunto.</hi> And in another place he exhorteth <hi>him that is not able to faſt, to abſtaine from dainties,</hi> and yet affirmeth, <hi>that it doth not much differ from faſting, and that it is a ſtrong weapon to repreſſe the furie of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi> Moreover, experience alſo it ſelfe doth more then prove, that theſe precepts concerning faſts, have been a great hinderance to godlineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Therefore when we ſaw it very evidently, that the chief men in the Church, did beſide the authoritie of the Scripture, take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves this power, ſo to enjoyne faſts, as to binde mens conſciences under paine of deadly ſinne, we did looſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences out of theſe ſnares, but by the Scriptures, and chiefly by <hi>Pauls</hi> writings, which doe with a ſingular endeavour remove theſe rudiments of the world from the necks of Chriſtians. For we ought not lightly to account of that ſaying of <hi>Paul: Let no man condemne you in meat and drinke, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the new Moone, or of the Sabbath daies.</hi> And again, <hi>Therefore if ye be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the world, why, as though ye lived in the world, are ye burdened with traditions?</hi> For if Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> then whom no man at any time did teach Chriſt more certainly, doe earneſtly affirme, that through Chriſt we have obtained ſuch libertie in outward things, that he doth not onely not give authoritie to any creature, to burden thoſe which beleeve in Chriſt, no not ſo much as with thoſe ceremonies and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which notwithſtanding God himſelf appointed, and would have to be profitable in their time; but alſo denounceth, <hi>that they be fallen away from Chriſt, and that Chriſt ſhall nothing at all profit them,</hi> who ſuffer themſelves to be addicted thereunto; what ſhall we then thinke of thoſe commandements, which men have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed of their owne braine, not onely without any oracle, but alſo without any example worthy to be followed, and which are therefore made unto many not onely beggerly and weake, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hurtfull, not elements, that is, rudiments of holy diſcipline,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:61072:219"/> but alſo impediments of true godlineſſe? How much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſhall any man take unto himſelfe-authoritie over the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Chriſt, to oppreſſe him with ſuch kinde of bondage? and how farre ſhall he remove us from Chriſt, if we ſubmit our ſelves unto him? For who doth not ſee, the glory of Chriſt, to whom we ought wholly to live, whom he hath wholly redeemed to himſelfe, and reſtored to libertie, and that by his blood, to be more obſcured, if beſide his authoritie, we doe binde our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe laws, which are the inventions of men, then to thoſe which have God for their Author, although they were to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but onely for their time? Certainly, it is a leſſe fault to play the Iew, then the Heathen. Now it is the manner of the Heathen; to receive laws for the worſhip of God, which have their beginning from mans invention onely, God never being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked counſell of in the matter. Wherefore if in any matter at all, certainly here that ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> taketh place: <hi>Ye are bought with a great price, be not made the ſervants of men.</hi>

And the Apoſtles were ſo farre from retaining them in the Church of Chriſt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing them, that they witneſſed plainly, that <hi>they would not lay</hi>

                     <hi>any burden upon the Church.</hi> Wherefore we ſhould ſeeme to bring in, and ſet up Iudaiſme againe, if ſo be we ſhould multiply Ceremonies, or Rites in the Church, according to the manner of the old Church. Therefore we are not of their judgement, who would have the Church of Chriſt kept in with many and diverſe Rites, as it were with a certaine ſchooling or pedagogie. For if the Apoſtles would not thruſt upon the Chriſtian people the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and rites, which were appointed by God, who is there (I pray you) that is well in his wits, that will thruſt upon it the inventions deviſed by man. The greater that the heape of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies is in the Church, ſo much the more is taken, not onely from Chriſtian libertie, but alſo from Chriſt and from faith in him: whileſt the people ſeeke thoſe things in ceremonies which
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61072:220"/> they ſhould ſeeke in the onely Son of God Ieſus Chriſt, through faith. Wherefore a few, moderate, and ſimple rites, that are not contrary to the word of God, do ſuffice the godly. And that there is found diverſitie of rites in the Churches, let no man ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Churches doe not agree. <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>That it were not poſsible to ſet down in writing all the ceremonies of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which are throughout Cities and Countries. No Religion doth keep every where the ſame ceremonies, although they admit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one and the ſelfe ſame doctrine touching them: for even they which have one and the ſelf ſame faith do diſagree among themſelves about ceremonies.</hi> Thus much ſaith <hi>Socrates,</hi> and we at this day having divers rites in the celebration of the Lords Supper, and in certaine other things, in our Churches, yet we doe not diſagree in doctrine and faith, neither is the unitie and ſocietie of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches rent aſunder. For the Churches have alwaies uſed their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie in ſuch rites, as being things indifferent, which we alſo do at this day.</p>
                  <p>But yet notwithſtanding we admoniſh men to take heed, that they count not among things indifferent ſuch as indeed are not indifferent, as ſome uſe to count the Maſſe, and the uſe of Images in the Church, for things indifferent. <hi>That is indifferent,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ierome</hi> to <hi>Auguſtine) which is neither good, nor evill, ſo that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you doe it, or doe it not, you are never the more iuſt, or uniuſt, thereby.</hi> Therefore, when things indifferent are wreſted to the confeſſion of ſaith, they ceaſe to be free, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſhew, <hi>that it is lawfull for a man to eate fleſh, if no man doe admoniſh him that it was offered to idols:</hi> for then it is unlawfull, becauſe he that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, doth ſeeme to approve idolatry by eating of it.</p>

                  <p>TOuching this acceſſorie kinde, humane traditions, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ceremonies brought in by a good cuſtome, men are taught that theſe be things inferiour in degree, and leſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, then are the gifts of the ordinary Miniſterie: yea, that they be inſtituted and appointed in regard of the Eccleſiaſticall miniſtery, and to ſerve thereunto: and yet that they are with an uniforme conſent to be retained in the Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies of Chriſtian people at the common ſervice of God, according to the doctrine of the holy Apoſtles: <hi>Let all things be done in your meeting</hi> (to wit in the Church) <hi>decently, and in order.</hi> Alſo, <hi>God is not the author of Confuſion, but of peace.</hi> But they muſt alwaies be kept with this caveat, and within theſe bounds, that they be not taken for foundations, whereupon ſalvation muſt ſtay it ſelfe, or for a worſhip, which is appointed of God without any difference; and that they doe not rather, or more ſtraightly binde the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, then the commandements of God doe; and that they be not lifted up or preferred before them, but that they be taken for an ornament, decency, honeſt ſhew, and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcipline; and ſo, that they doe not violate the Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the Spirit of God, and of faith, nor diſturbe charitie: and on the other ſide, that no man, by pretending a ſhew of Chriſtian libertie, doe withdraw himſelfe from ſuch conſtitutions, as be godly, and ſerve to a good uſe.</p>
                  <p>Now by the name of <hi>Chriſtian libertie</hi> is chiefly underſtood<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. Rom. 6. Rom. 8. Act. 15. Pſal. 18. and 110.</note> that libertie, whereby through Chriſt we are freed from ſinne, and the curſe, and the yoke of the law: ſecondly, the receiving of the Spirit of a ready will, or of the voluntary Spirit of the ſons of God, whereby they doe earneſtly, and with pleaſure, and of their owne

Iac. 1.</note> their neighbour; and by the law of charitie, the minde is ſtirred up to performe theſe things, rather of love, then of debt, or any compulſion: Alſo, whereby we are made free from all bond of conſcience to any humane traditions, that a man may not be tied in ſuch ſort, or rather more ſtrictly, unto theſe, then to the commandements of God: And laſtly, that no man may ſuffer his conſcience to be ſeared thereby, as with an hot iron. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to theſe things, all thoſe humane traditions and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which do obſcure or take away the glory, honour, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and doe withdraw the people from true and ſincere faith, and in a word, in reſpect whereof the commandements of God are broken, neglected, and lightly regarded, and the word of God is not exerciſed, or handled according to its own ſinceritie and truth, they are not onely not to be obſerved, but to be avoided. For Chriſt our Lord doth ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproove thoſe Phariſees, and Maſters of the Iews, by the name of ſuch rites and traditions, and for that they doe obſerve ſuch,<note place="margin">Matth. 7. Iſa. 29.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>Very well hath</hi> Eſay <hi>prophecied of you, hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is farre away from me. But they worſhip me in vaine, ſeeing that they teach ſuch doctrine, as is delivered, and brought in by men. For ye lay the commandements of God apart, and obſerve the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men.</hi> And holy <hi>Paul</hi> doth admoniſh us, to take heed of ſuch toyes deviſed by men, when he ſaith, <hi>Beware, leſt there be any that ſpoile you through Philoſophy, and vaine deceit, through the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt.</hi> Whereof alſo there be Canons extant in the Canon law,<note place="margin">Diſt. 8. &amp; 11. cap conſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, whether they have their beginning and be brought in of Biſhops, or of Eccleſiaſticall Councels, or of any other Authors whatſoever, the ſimpler ſort are not to care for it, neither to be mooved or diſquieted, but to uſe them to good, becauſe they are good, and to obſerve this onely rule therein, as alwayes to put their greateſt confidence in thoſe things onely, which are of God,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:61072:222"/> ſettle their onely and chiefe refuge in thoſe things, and withall diligence take heed, that they be not withdrawne by ſuch cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies from thoſe things, which are the chiefeſt of all, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in religion is founded, and ſo by conſequent from the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For thoſe divine and wholſome things are to be preferred in every reſpect, before all other things of all men, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ought to be bound to them alone. For the Lord himſelfe did pronounce a <hi>woe</hi> againſt thoſe Elders of the Iews, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their own traditions before the commandements of God, and thoſe which were the leſſer before things of greater weight: <hi>You leave,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the weightieſt matters of the law, as iudgement,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>and mercie, and fidelitie. Theſe ought ye to have done, and not to</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>have left the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And although our Preachers doe not keepe all rites alike with other Churches, the which thing neither can be, neither is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be done, that in all places, where there be Chriſtian aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies one and the ſame ceremonies ſhould be uſed, yet they doe not withſtand, or oppoſe themſelves to any good and godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, neither are they ſo minded, as that for the ceremonies ſake they would raiſe up any diſſenſions, although they ſhould thinke that ſome of them were not very neceſſary, ſo that they be not found to be contrary to God, and to his worſhip, and glory, and be ſuch, as doe not diminiſh true faith in Ieſus Chriſt, which alone doth purchaſe righteouſneſſe. How be it in this place, and in this point, it muſt not be paſſed over with ſilence, to wit, that we ought by no means to burden the people with many ſuperfluous, and grievous traditions, ſuch as the Moſaicall traditions were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law. For the Apoſtles forbad that this ſhould be done, as alſo holy <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto certaine concerning this matter: <hi>Why do ye tempt God in laying a yoke upon the necks of the diſciples?</hi> Alſo,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Be ye not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, intangled with the yoke of bondage.</hi> For which cauſe alſo Chriſt did vehemently inveigh againſt the Scribes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Woe alſo be to you Scribes, for ye lay burdens upon mens ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which can ſcarſe be borne.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo men are taught to acknowledge this, that humane tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttions do not containe a perpetuall &amp; immutable law, but as they are for juſt cauſes inſtituted of men, ſo alſo they may upon juſt and weightie cauſes, and if the matter ſo require, be broken, abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and changed without any ſin, according to the example of the Apoſtles. <hi>who did tranſgreſſe the traditions of the Elders, when
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:61072:222"/> as they did eate bread with unwaſhed hands,</hi> and did not obſerve the<note place="margin">Matth. 15. Mark. 7.</note> ſame faſts with others, and yet they were not by this means guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of any ſin: alſo according to the example of the firſt and holy Church, upon which the Apoſtles, and the whole Councell layed this commandement by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>that they ſhould abſtaine</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> 
                     <hi>from the eating of thoſe things which were ſacrificed to Idols, and of blood, and of that which is ſtrangled.</hi> Notwithſtanding, after that the cauſes and occaſions, for the which this decree was made, in proceſſe of time did vaniſh away, even this Apoſtolicall conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did grow out of uſe. Neither in theſe things ought we to care for the offence of the wicked, who are offended with this thing, as the Lord faith, <hi>Let them alone, they be blind, and guides of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>the blind.</hi> And on the other ſide, we muſt take diligent heed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that no offence be given to little ones, by a raſh, froward,<note place="margin">Rom 14. 1 Cor. 8. Matth. 15.</note> and wicked uſing of Chriſtian libertie: for this alſo the Lord ſaith, <hi>Woe be to that man by whom offence cometh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if ſo be that there be any unlikeneſſe in traditions, and externall ceremonies, and if any diverſitie which is not hurtfull be found in Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies, certainly no man ought to be ſo ignorant in theſe things, as for this cauſe to be offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, or to take offence at others, and in this reſpect to reproach or hurt others, or to be an author of ſects and alſo of factions, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there was never in all places one, and the ſame forme of an Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution in this point, neither is at this day the ſame. The which thing alſo is mentioned in the books of the Canon law in theſe words: <hi>The holy Church of Rome doth know,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diſt. 12 Cap. Scit.</note> 
                     <hi>that conſtitutions, and cuſtomes being divers, according to time and place, do nothing at all hinder the ſalvation of the faithfull if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall authoritie be not againſt them.</hi> Rather it becometh every ſound Chriſtian to be content in his conſcience to reſt in that, if he ſee Chriſtians to have the one ſpirit of Chriſt, and with agreeing<note place="margin">Phil. 2. Eph. 4.</note> mindes to hold and follow his true meaning, and one and the ſame doctrine, in all theſe things, and chiefe points of ſaith. For <hi>he that hath not this Spirit of Chriſt, he is not Chriſts,</hi> as the Apoſtle<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> doth witneſſe, although he uſe all, and every kinde of ceremonies, or conſtitutions. Therefore whoſoever be Chriſts, this is their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as in all other ſuch like things, that as members of one body, they doe ſuffer, and beare one with another in charitie, without<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> the which no thing can profit any whit, according to the meaning of the Apoſtolike doctrine.</p>

They will needs have the Churches power and authoritie to be very great, becauſe it hath diſpenſed with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the morall law. But of this queſtion our men doe thus teach, that the Biſhops have no power to ordaine any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Goſpell, as was ſhewed before. The ſame alſo doe the Canons teach. <hi>diſtinct.</hi> 9. Moreover it is againſt the Scripture, to ordaine or require the obſervation of any traditions, to the end that we might merit remiſſion of ſinnes, and ſatisfie for ſinnes by them. For the glorie of Chriſts merit receiveth a blow, when as we ſeeke by ſuch obſervations to merit remiſſion of ſinnes and juſtification. And it is very apparant, that through this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion traditions grew into an infinite number in the Church. In the meane while the doctrine of faith, and of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, was quite ſmoothered: for ever and anone there were new holidaies made, new faſts appointed, new ceremonies,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61072:224"/> new worſhips for Saints ordained, becauſe that the authors of ſuch geare ſuppoſed by theſe works to merit remiſſion of ſinnes and juſtification. After the ſame manner heretofore did the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiall Canons increaſe, whereof we ſtill ſee ſome footings in ſatisfactions.</p>
                     <p>Againe, many writers imagine, that in the New Teſtament there ſhould be a worſhip like to the Leviticall worſhip, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing whereof God committed to the Apoſtles and Biſhops, wherein they ſeeme to be deceived by the example of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as if the righteouſneſſe of the New Teſtament were the outward obſerving of certain rites, as the juſtice of the law was. Like as therefore in the law it was a ſinne to eate ſwines fleſh, &amp;c. ſo in the New Teſtament they place ſinne in meates, in daies, in apparell, and ſuch like things: and they hold oppinion, that the righteouſneſſe of the New Teſtament can not ſtand without theſe. From hence are thoſe burdens, that certaine meats defile the conſcience, that it is a mortall ſinne to omit the canonicall houres, that faſtings merit remiſſion of ſinnes, becauſe they be neceſſary to the righteouſneſſe of the New Teſtament, that a ſin in a caſe reſerved, cannot be pardoned, but by the authoritie of him that reſerved it: whereas the Canons ſpeake onely of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of Canonicall puniſhments, and not of the reſerving of the fault. Whence then have the Biſhops power and authoritie of impoſing theſe traditions upon the Churches, for the burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mens conſciences? For there are divers cleare teſtimonies which inhibit the making of ſuch traditions, either for to deſerve remiſſion of ſinnes, or as things neceſſarie to the righteouſneſſe of the New Teſtament, or to ſalvation. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſ. 2.

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:61072:225"/> burden the Churches with innumerable traditions, and to ſnare mens conſciences, why doth the Scripture ſo oft forbid to make and to liſten to traditions? why doth it call them the Devils traditions? hath the holy Ghoſt warned us of them to no purpoſe?</p>
                     <p>It remaineth then, that ſeeing conſtitutions ordained as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, or with opinion of meriting remiſſion of ſinnes by them, are flat repugnant to the Goſpel, becauſe that it is not lawfull for any Biſhops to appoint or urge any ſuch worſhip. For it is very requiſite, that the doctrine of Chriſtian libertie ſhould be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Church, becauſe that the bondage of the law is not neceſſary unto juſtification, as it is written to the <hi>Gal. Come not ye under the yoke of bondage again.</hi> It is neceſſary that the chiefeſt point of all the Goſpel ſhould be holden faſt, that we doe freely obtain remiſſion of ſins and juſtification by faith in Chriſt, and not by any obſervations, nor by any worſhip deviſed by man. For though they ſeek to qualifie traditions, yet the equitie of them can never be ſeen nor perceived, ſo long as the opinion of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie remaineth, which muſt needs remain, where the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith and Chriſtian libertie are not known. The Apoſtles <hi>commanded them to abſtaine from bloud:</hi> who obſerveth that now a dayes? and yet they doe not ſinne that obſerve it not: for the Apoſtles themſelves would not burden mens conſciences with ſuch a ſervitude. but they forbad it for a time, for offence ſake. For in that decree the perpetuall intent and minde of the Goſpel is to be conſidered: ſcarcely any canons are preciſely kept, and many grow out of uſe daily, yea even among them that doe moſt buſily defend traditions: Neither can there be ſufficient care had of mens conſciences, except this equitie be kept, that men ſhould know, that ſuch rites are not to be obſerved, with any opinion of neceſſitie, and that mens conſciences are not hurt though tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions grow out of uſe.</p>
                     <p>The Biſhops might <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> eaſily retaine lawfull obedience, if they would not have men to obſerve ſuch traditions, as cannot be kept with a good conſcience. But now they command ſingle life, and they admit none, except they will ſweare not to teach the pure doctrine of the Goſpel. The Churches doe not deſire of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, that they would repaire peace and concord with the loſſe of their honour, which yet good Paſtors ought to doe: onely they deſire that they would remit unjuſt burdens, which are both
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:61072:225"/> new, and received contrary to the cuſtome of the Catholike Church. It may well be, that ſome conſtitutions had ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable cauſes, when they began, which yet will not agree to latter times. It is evident, that ſome were received through errour. Wherefore it were for the <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. Obſervat.</note> chiefe Biſhops gentleneſſe, to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them now, for ſuch a change would not overthrow the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church. For many humane traditions have been chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in time, as the Canons themſelves declare. But if it cannot be obtained, that thoſe obſervations may not be releaſed, which cannot be kept without ſin, then muſt we follow the Apoſtles rule, which willeth <hi>to obey God rather then men.</hi> Peter <hi>forbiddeth Biſhops to be Lords, and to be imperious over the Churches.</hi> Our meaning is not to have <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. obſervation.</note> rule taken from the Biſhops. But this one thing is requeſted at their hands, that they would ſuffer the Goſpel to be purely taught, and that they would releaſe a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, which cannot be obſerved without ſin. But if they will remit none, let them look how they will give account to God for this that by their wilfulneſſe they give occaſion of ſchiſme.</p>

                     <p>NOw come I to the queſtion in hand, touching the laws of Biſhops: concerning which firſt this moſt certaine rule is to be holden, That it is not lawfull for any to make lawes repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the commandement of God. That ſentence of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is well known: <hi>If an Angel from heaven teach any other Goſpel, let him be accurſed.</hi> Vpon this foundation, which is ſure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, the reſt may eaſily be reared. Now there be three or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the decrees of Biſhops <hi>Some doe conſtraine a man to ſinne,</hi> as the law of ſingle life, the laws of private Maſſes, wherein is made an oblation and application for the quick and the dead. And the opinion of Tranſubſtantiation breedeth a wicked adoration. Alſo the commandement of praying to the dead. It is an eaſie matter to give ſentence of theſe lawes. For ſeeing they doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly oppugne the commandement of God, the Apoſtles rule is, <hi>We ought rather to obey God then men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſecond order is of thoſe rites, which concern things in their own nature indifferent,</hi> ſuch as are the lawes touching the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of meats, and daies, and ſuch like things. But when falſe
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:61072:226"/> opinions are joyned unto theſe things, they are no more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Now our adverſaries doe, ſome more, ſome leſſe, tie unto them abſurd and falſe opinions, for the which both thoſe lawes and rites are to be caſt off, leſt any corrupt worſhip ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed. The moſt part doe feigne, that the works of mans traditions, as ſatisfactions, and ſuch like, doe merit remiſſion of ſinnes. This opinion is apparantly falſe: for it removeth the benefit of Chriſt unto mans traditions. And there needeth here no long confutation: we will content our ſelves with one thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul, Ye are made void of Chriſt, whoſoever are iuſtified by the law: Ye are fallen from Chriſt.</hi> This ſaying teacheth, that men doe not merit remiſſion of ſinnes by the proper workes, either of Gods law, or of mans traditions. Others being put in minde, what groſſe abſurditie there is in this firſt errour, they begin to talke more modeſtly of traditions. But yet they hold ſtill an errour, that is not to be borne withall. They ſay, <hi>That theſe workes, though they doe not deſerve remiſſion of ſins, yet are they ſervices of God, that is, workes, the immediate end whereof is, that God by them might be honoured.</hi> This errour alſo muſt be ſtiffely withſtood. For Chriſt ſaith plainly, <hi>They worſhip me in vaine with the precepts of men.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> doth expreſſely condemne <hi>will worſhip</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> And ſeeing that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God muſt be done in faith, it is neceſſary that we ſhould have the word of God, that may teſtifie that the worke pleaſeth God. For how can the conſcience offer a worke unto God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there be a voyce of God, which may declare, that God will be ſo worſhipped or ſerved with this honour? But ungodly men underſtanding this Doctrine of faith, have in all ages with dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable boldneſſe deviſed worſhips, without commandement or word of God, which thing if it be lawfull to doe, you can ſhew no cauſe why the heatheniſh ſacrifices, ſlaying of dogs, ſacrifices offered at <hi>Lampſacum</hi> to <hi>Priapus,</hi> and ſuch like monſtrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould not pleaſe God. Whether hath mans foolehardineſſe ruſhed, not onely amongſt the Ethnicks, in feigning worſhips, but alſo among the Popiſh rout in deviſing eft-ſoons new and fooliſh ceremonies, in prayer to the dead, in the worſhipping of Saints, and in the babling of Monks. Here therefore let us be watchfull, and not ſuffer lawes to be thruſt upon the Churches, which preſcribe workes without the commadement of God, as Gods worſhip and mans righteouſneſſe. And whereas all our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:61072:226"/> even they that ſpeake moſt modeſtly, doe tie this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of worſhip unto thoſe workes, let us know, that it is a good work to withſtand them, and by violating ſuch traditions to ſhew a patterne, by which the godly may know what to judge of them. As <hi>Euſcbius</hi> writeth of <hi>Attalus, That he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God to ſpeake unto a certaine man which eat nothing but bread, ſalt, and water, that he would uſe common meat, leſt hee ſhould bring others into error.</hi> Moreover this ſecond errour which maketh theſe workes to bee the worſhip of God, brake farther. For many in the Church were deceived through a perverſe emulation of the Leviticall ceremonies, and did thinke that there ſhould be ſome ſuch rites in the New Teſtament, and that they are the worſhip of God, or things whereby God will be honoured, yea and that they are righteouſneſſe. And for that cauſe they gave authoritie to the Biſhops to ordaine ſuch rites and ſuch ſervices. This Phariſaicall errour Chriſt and his Apoſtles noted, who taught, that the worſhip of the New Teſtament is repentance, the feare of God, faith, and the workes of the Ten Commandements, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The kingdome of God is not meat, and drinke, but righteouſneſſe, and peace, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt. For he that in theſe ſerveth Chriſt, pleaſeth God, and is approved of men.</hi> The Monks fained themſelves to be Nazarites. The Maſſe Prieſts that ſacrifice for the dead, would have men thinke that they imitate <hi>Aaron</hi> offering ſacrifices. But theſe examples doe not agree: the rites of Monks, and the Prieſts mercenarie Maſſes, have no word of God for them, yea there are many fond opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mingled with them, which of neceſſitie muſt be reproved in our Churches.</p>
                     <p>The third errour is the opinion of neceſſitie, wherein they imagine that the Church is like unto other humane govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For they ſurmiſe that it is a kingdome, wherein the Biſhops, as if they were Kings, have power to make new laws, that are beſides the Goſpel, and that they muſt of neceſſitie be obeyed (even as the Princes laws muſt neceſſarily be obeyed) eſpecially ſeeing this life of man cannot be without traditions. And this opinion of the neceſſitie of theſe things, hath ſtirred up contentions, whileſt every one defendeth his owne rites inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by man, as ſimply neceſſarie. But Chriſt and his Apoſtles teach that ſuch rites ſet forth without Gods Commandements, are not to be taken for things neceſſary. Againſt this libertie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:61072:227"/> and eſtabliſhed by Gods authoritie, the opinion which maintaineth that the violating of traditions about things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent though it be not in a caſe where offence may be given, is not to be received. Hitherto belongeth the ſaying of <hi>Paul, Let no man iudge you in meate and drinke, and entercourſe of holy daies, &amp;c.</hi> For to judge ſignifieth to binde the conſciences, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them that doe not obey. Againe, <hi>Gal. 5. Stand in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie wherein Chriſt hath made you free.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hitherto it hath bin ſhewed in what reſpect it is not lawfull to appoint traditions, or to approve them. Now ſome man may aske whether we would have this life of man to be without order and rites? No ſurely. But we teach that the true Paſtors of the churches may ordain publike rites in their Churches, but ſo, as it be only for an end belonging to the body, that is, for good orders ſake, to wit, ſuch rites, as availe for the inſtruction of the people: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſet daies, ſet leſſons, and ſuch like, and that without any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and opinion of neceſſitie, as hath been ſaid before, ſo that it may not be counted any ſin to violate any of theſe ordinances, ſo it be not with giving offence. But if ſo be that they be broken with offence there, where the Churches are well ordered, and there is no error in doctrine, let him that in ſuch place breaketh them know, that he doth offend, becauſe he diſturbeth the peace of the Church wel ordered, or doth withdraw others from the true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery. This reaſon doth ſufficiently warrant the authority of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable traditions, and layeth no ſnare on mens conſciences. So the Church in the beginning of it, ordained ſet dayes, as the Lords day, the day of Chriſts nativitie, Eaſter, Pentecoſt, &amp;c. Neither did the Church diſpence with the morall precepts, but Gods own authoritie abrogated the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> law. And yet it was meet that the people ſhould know when to come together to the hearing of the Goſpel, and unto the ceremonies which Chriſt did ordain. And for that cauſe certain dayes were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that uſe, without any ſuch opinions as were above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. And the general equity abideth ſtill in the morall law, that at certain times we ſhould come together to theſe godly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but the ſpecial day, which was but a ceremonie, is free. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apoſtles retained not the ſeventh day, but did rather take the firſt day of the week for that uſe, that by it they might admoniſh the godly both of their libertie, and of Chriſts reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 4. Obſervat.</note> The things objected againſt this may eaſily be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:61072:227"/> The Apoſtles decree touching things offered to Idols, and fornication, was moral, and perpetuall: but in that which they added, touching bloud, and that which was ſtrangled, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of offence giving at that time. For it was an uſe even before the Apoſtles time, that ſuch as then were conquered by the Iews ſhould abſtain from bloud &amp; things ſtrangled. The Apoſtles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have laid no new thing upon thoſe, that were joyned unto their fellowſhip, but as yet they kept the old uſuall rite, which was pleaſing both to the godly Iews, and ſuch as joyned with them in the ſociety of Chriſt. As for that which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you:</hi> doubtleſſe he meant not thoſe fooliſh ceremonies that the Popes have brought in, nor that any new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, but a farther illumination of that Goſpel, which he had already delivered. And therefore afterward he addeth touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the office of the holy Ghoſt, that he ſhould not bring any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of doctrine, but ſhould enlighten the minds of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that they ſhould underſtand the Goſpel touching the will of God, which before had been taught. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Ioh. 14. He ſhall teach you all things, and ſhall bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, which I have ſhewed you.</hi> Againe, <hi>He ſhall not ſpeake of himſelfe, but what he hath heard, that ſhall he ſpeake.</hi>

                  <p>ALthough for orders ſake there muſt needs be ſome decent and ſeemely Ceremonies; yet notwithſtanding men that<note place="margin">Artic. 20.</note> are given to ſuperſtition doe ſoone pervert thoſe Ceremonies, falſly imagining that ſuch obſervations doe merit forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and are accepted for righteous in the ſight of God: and do turne the ſignes into Gods, like as many have aſcribed a Godhead unto Images: and many, either of ſuperſtition, or by tyrannie, doe heape up Ceremonies: and ſuperſtition hath increaſed in the Church the Ceremonies of ſatisfaction, as they call them. <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> becauſe they are of opinion, that conſent in Religion is availeable to the peaceable governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their kingdomes, doe ordaine ſuch ſervice of God, as they will have indifferently obſerved of all their ſubjects.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:61072:228"/> There new laws, and new gods were erected, not of ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by tyranny. Thus we obſerve that amongſt men true and falſe religion are confounded, and each changed into other, and we marvell at the cauſe, why men doe not ſtedfaſtly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the truth revealed by God. But the word of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, that men are ſet on by Devils to fall away from God: and the nature of man being blinde, curious, and inconſtant, loveth to play with divers opinions. Againſt theſe great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieves God armeth and confirmeth his Church, and delivereth a ſure and certaine doctrine, which is contained in the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and in the Creed. Wherefore it is neceſſary to conſider, what thoſe lawes, or rites be, and whence they had their beginning.</p>
                  <p>The firſt rule therefore is this: It is lawfull for no creature, neither for Angels, nor for men, neither for Kings nor for <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to make laws, or ordaine ceremonies, diſagreeing from the word of God. Horribly ſinned the King of Babylon, although he excelled in wiſedome and valour, when he commanded his Image to be worſhipped; and all men doe ſinne that obey ſuch Proclamations or lawes: even as <hi>Eve</hi> ſinned, when ſhe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the commandement of God, for the lying perſwaſion of the Devill. But generally the rule is to be obſerved, which is ſet downe, <hi>Act. 5. We ought rather to obey God then men.</hi> Such are the Edicts which command to call upon dead men, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace falſe doctrine, or to uſe ungodly worſhip. Touching all theſe, that Rule of the firſt Commandement is to be holden, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. Flie from Idols.</hi> Such is alſo the law of the ſingle life of Prieſts, which many can not obſerve without ſinne. And albeit we know what opinion politique and expert men doe hold of the change of lawes, yet God hath ſo commanded obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that ſtill he would have us faſt tied unto himſelfe, and to agree with his wiſedome and righteouſneſſe. From whence do ariſe thoſe unchangeable and perpetuall rules, <hi>Exod. 20. Thou ſhalt have no ſtrange gods.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Act. 5. We ought rather to obey God then men,</hi> Alſo, <hi>Gal 1. If any man teach you any other Goſpel, let him be accurſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond rule. For as much as it is uſuall to adde ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe works, which otherwiſe in their owne nature were indifferent, as to eate, or not to eate fleſh, it is neceſſarie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſuch ſuperſtitions and errours, as are in this ſort added, and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:61072:228"/> in the practice of our libertie, examples of this doctrine may mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly be ſhewed. And that errour is not among the leaſt, which the folly of many teachers, and for the moſt part of the people bringeth in, in that they teach and thinke that faſting and ſuch like works deſerve forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, both of the guiltineſſe, and of the paine: as both <hi>Thomas</hi> doth write of ſatisfactions, and many alſo doe ſay the ſame. This Phariſaicall imagination eaſily intangleth the mindes of men, and darkeneth the light of the doctrine of the benefits proper to Chriſt, and of free forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and of faith. For when as men think that they merit remiſſion of ſinnes by theſe their Ceremonies, they take away the honour due unto Chriſt, and give it unto theſe ceremonies, and are ſomewhat puffed up with vaine confidence. Yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when they be in true ſorrow, they fall headlong into many doubts, which turne to their deſtruction. And of it ſelfe it is a great ſinne, not to know the benefits of God. For this cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly contendeth for the aboliſhing of circumciſion, and other ceremonies of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for feare leſt the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Mediatour might be cleane put out, if men ſhould thinke that they deſerved remiſſion of ſinnes, and were made righteous by this obſervation of the law and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the Phariſees did avouch. And oftentimes <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſheth to beware that the light of the Goſpel be not darkened by new ceremonies of mans invention. This ſecond er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is not ſo evident, but yet very dangerous. After that ſome men ſee that this Phariſaicall errour cannot be defended, they come to this: Although, ſay they, theſe ceremonies deſerve not remiſſion of ſinnes, yet are theſe traditions defended, becauſe they are good workes and ſervices of God: as in the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> the abſtinence of the Nazarites, although it deſerved not the remiſſion of ſinnes, yet it pleaſed God, and was a ſervice accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God. With this colour certaine of late have learned to paint traditions, which yet ſtrive not about theſe indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but go about to eſtabliſh other foule errors, and the opinion of the power of Biſhops. But it is neceſſary for the godly here to beware of deceitfull doctrine. There is a great error even in this colourable reaſon: neither is that example well alledged out of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The workes ordained and commanded by God do farre differ from workes not commanded nor ordained by God, but onely deviſed by mans invention. The workes ordained in the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:61072:229"/> law of God, were ſervices of God, although they deſerved for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes. But wil worſhip deviſed by men, neither have beene, nor are any ſervice of God: God doth not allow this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, which notwithſtanding hath alwaies beene uſuall, to deviſe new worſhip, that is, ſuch as is immediately intended to honour God withall. Therefore the Word of God crieth out, <hi>Matth. 15. In vaine doe they worſhip me after the ordinances of men.</hi> And every where in the Apoſtles, and in <hi>Paul,</hi> this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is reproved. But the true ſervice of God are thoſe works, that he hath commanded, which are done in the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confidence of the Mediatour, to the end, that God may be obeyed, and that we may profeſſe him to be the true God, whom we ſo worſhip. So alſo <hi>Ezec.</hi> 20 he calleth us back to the commandement of God, ſaying: <hi>Walke not after the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of your fathers, but walke in my commandements.</hi> And often are ſuch warnings repeated. And <hi>Pſal. 1 18. Thy word is a lanterne to my feet.</hi> And <hi>Numb. 15. Let them not follow their owne imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third error is this. Hypocrites doe imagine that ſuch works are a kinde of perfection: as Monks doe preferre their vowes full of vanitie before the civill and houſholders life: whereas God by his wonderfull providence hath ſo joyned mankinde together in fellowſhip, and in theſe travels and dangers would have our faith, prayer, and confeſſion, or liberalitie one toward another, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and other vertues, to be tried.</p>
                  <p>The fourth errour is, the opinion of neceſſitie, as ſome doe write, That the faſting of Lent is neceſſary, and other things are arbitrary. Neither is it onely a torment of conſcience, to judge that he is no Chriſtian nor member of the Church of God, that eateth fleſh on the Saturday, or obſerveth not the faſt of Lent; but it is alſo an error that darkeneth great matters, as the doctrine of the righteouſnes of the Goſpel, and of the Church, what manner of Church it is, and how the members of the Church are to be diſcerned, not by meat and drink, but by faith, prayer, and other vertues. And againſt the opinion of neceſſitie it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Col. 2. Let no man iudge you in meat or drinke.</hi> And <hi>Gal. 5. Stand in the libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made you free, and be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine intangled with the yoke of bondage.</hi> And that opinion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie hath alwaies bread great diſcord: as in time paſt there was great contention about Eaſter day, and about leven, and now
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:61072:229"/> alſo many ſuch like contentions have riſen.</p>
                  <p>The fifth errour. To the former opinions this errour alſo is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Biſhops take to themſelves authoritie to ordaine new kinds of worſhip, and to binde conſciences, as <hi>Gregory</hi> hath ordained, <hi>That married men tranſlated to the order of prieſthood ſhould forſake the company of their wives,</hi> and the conſtitution of confeſſion commandeth to recken up ſins, and decrees have been made of differences of meats, and faſting, and ſuch like. Of ſuch traditions there are alſo late bookes ſet forth, full of labyrinths, wherein it is written, that the tranſgreſſions of ſuch ceremonies are mortall ſins, yea though they be committed without giving offence to others. <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſought for ſome mittigations, but the true comfort is the voice of the Goſpel, which would have the underſtanding of this liberty to be made knowne and maintained in the Church, namely by removing thoſe errors whereof hath been ſpoken. But ceremonies invented by man, ſuch as are ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deviſed for order, may be obſerved without any opinion of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, worſhip, or neceſſitie, as hath been aforeſaid out of the <hi>Col. 2. Let no man iudge you in meat or drinke.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Act. 15. Why do ye tempt God laying upon the necks of the diſciples a yoke, which neither your fathers, nor we were able to beare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third rule. Thoſe errors being removed, whereof the Church muſt needs be admoniſhed, afterward we both obſerve certain ceremonies, which are comely, and made for good order, and alſo teach that they ought to be obſerved, even as men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without order.

But it is not lawfull for them to thruſt upon the Church the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the old law for the holy ſervice wherewithall God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is worſhipped. Neither is it lawfull either to reſtore the old ceremonies of the law, or deviſe new, to ſhadow forth the truth already laid open, and brought to light by the Goſpel: as in the day light to ſet up candles, to ſignifie the light of the Goſpel, or to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie banners and croſſes, to ſignifie the victory of Chriſt through the Croſſe.

                  <p>FVrthermore, touching the traditions of the Fathers or ſuch as the Biſhops and Churches doe at this day ordaine, this is the opinion of our men. They reckon no traditions for mens tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſuch as are condemned in Scripture, but ſuch as are contrary to the law of God, ſuch as binde the Conſcience about meat, drink, and times, and other outward things, ſuch as forbid marriage to them who have need thereof, to live honeſtly, and the reſt of that ſtamp. For ſuch as agree with the Scripture, and were ordained for good manners and the profit of men, although they be not word for word expreſſed in the Scriptures, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in that they proceede from the commandement of love, which ordereth all things moſt decently, they are worthily to be accounted rather of God, then of man. Of this ſort were thoſe ſet downe by <hi>Paul,</hi> that women ſhould not pray in the Church bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,<note place="margin">1 Cor 14. 1 Cor. 14.</note> nor men with their heads covered, that they who are to communicate together ſhould tarry one for another: that no man ſhould ſpeake with tongues in the congregation without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter: that the Prophets without confuſion ſhould deliver their Prophecies to be judged by them that ſit by. Many ſuch the Church at this day for good cauſe obſerveth, and upon occaſion alſo maketh new, which who ſo refuſeth, he deſpiſeth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, not of men, but of God, whoſe tradition, it is, whatſoever is profitable. For, <hi>whatſoever truth is ſaid or written, by his gift it is ſpoken and written, who is truth,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath godly written. But oftentimes there is diſputing about that, what tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is profitable, what not: that is, what ſet forward godlineſſe, what doth hinder it. But he that ſhall ſeek nothing of his owne, but ſhall wholly dedicate himſelfe to the publike profit, he ſhall eaſily ſee, what things are agreeable to the law of God, what are not. Furthermore, ſeeing the eſtate of Chriſtians is ſuch, that they are alſo helped by injuries, the Chriſtian will not refuſe to obey, no not unjuſt lawes, ſo they have no wicked thing in them,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:61072:231"/> according to the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>If any man compell thee to goe with him one mile, go with him two.</hi> Even ſo ſervile the Chriſtian ought to become all unto all, that he may ſtudie to do and ſuffer all things, ſo that they be not contrary to the commandements of God, to pleaſure and profit men withall.

We teach that marriages ought to be made lawfully, in the feare of the Lord, and not againſt the lawes, which forbid certaine degrees to joyn in matrimony, leſt the marriages ſhould be inceſtuous. Let mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages be made with conſent of the parents, or ſuch as be inſtead of parents, and for that end eſpecially, for the which the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained marriages: and let them be confirmed publikely in the Church, with prayer, and bleſſing of them. Moreover, let them be kept holy, with peace, faithfulneſſe, dutifulnes, love, &amp; alſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the perſons coupled together. Therefore let them take heed of brawlings, debates, luſts, and adulteries. Let lawfull judgements and holy Iudges be eſtabliſhed in the Church, which may maintaine marriages, and may repreſſe all diſhoneſtie, and ſhamefulneſſe, and before whom the controverſies in matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie may be decided, and ended.</p>
                  <p>Let children alſo be brought up of the Parents in the feare of the Lord, and let Parents provide for their children, remembring the ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>He that provideth not for his owne, hath</hi>

Now it is moſt certaine, that thoſe workes which parents doe in a true faith by the duties of marriage, and government of their families, are before God holy and good workes indeed, and doe pleaſe God no leſſe, then prayers, faſtings, and almes deeds. For ſo the Apoſtle hath taught in his Epiſtles, eſpecially in thoſe to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> And with the ſame Apoſtle we account the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſuch as forbid marriage or doe openly diſpraiſe, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly diſcredit it as not holy, or cleane, amongſt the <hi>doctrines of Devils.</hi> And we doe deteſt unclean ſingle life, licentious luſts, and fornications, both open, and cloſe, and the continencie of

For which cauſes our miniſters thinke,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:61072:232"/> that they are more ready preſt, and more fit for the Eccleſiaſticall Miniſterie, which are unmarried: yet they meane ſuch unmarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons, as have this peculiar gift given to them of God, that they may remaine ſuch, and ſo give themſelves wholly to the Miniſtery.

And as concerning the Church, and certaine men, and chiefly the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church, our men have taught from the beginning, and do now teach, firſt, that the gift of chaſtitie, by the peculiar good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, and of the holy Ghoſt, both in times paſt was given, and at this day alſo is given to ſome, for the ſingular uſe and profit of the Church, as Chriſt his ſpeech doth evidently witneſſe. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

                        <hi>given.</hi> And holy <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth both place and celebrate this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt peculiar gifts, and whereunto ſome are peculiarly called. And moreover, the examples of certaine in the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall writings, and of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and of many Miniſters,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:61072:233"/> and <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. Obſervat.</note> women miniſters of the Church, doe witneſſe this thing.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place they teach that this gift is not of fleſh and blood (for the Lord by diſtinguiſhing doth remove and ſeparate from hence that unableneſſe which is in this kinde) but of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is jealous, who from his heart hath a care and pleaſure in the glory of God, and in his own and his neighbours ſalvation, and alſo in the Miniſtery of the Church, and for this cauſe he doth of his owne accord abſtaine from wedlocke: Therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thoſe which have made themſelves Eunuches for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>of heaven:</hi> that is, who be ſuch, as might be married, yet they do omit and abſtaine from it, becauſe of the affection of the inward heart and their love toward God, and his word, and for the pleaſure and joy which they receive thereof: and through this gift of the ſpirit, whoſe vertue and power doth overcome the motions of nature, they doe preſerve the pureneſſe as well <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. Obſervation.</note> of the ſpirit, as of the body: howbeit this thing is not in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour and difficultie, even as it is a thing of no ſmall labour and difficultie for all Chriſtian men to forſake, and to want the uſe of other pleaſant things, and alſo ſuch as are profitable for this life, as friends, riches, and money.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that ſingle life is to be choſen, and taken with a true intent and a godly meaning, that is, not to this end, or with this purpoſe, that a man would by this means merit or get unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or to another, remiſſion of ſins, and eternall life, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſalvation it ſelf. For there is no continencie or chaſtitie, nor any humane action, or other vertue, which can merit: the onely innocencie and death of the onely begotten Son of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt doth performe and perfit this thing. Neither muſt the thing be received with this meaning, as to thinke that ſome dignitie is added to the holy miniſterie of the Church by reaſon of this gift: or that the works of thoſe that be unmarried in this miniſtery, are to be preferred in merit and dignitie before the works of married men: but as the Lord ſaith, <hi>that it may be received for the kingdome of heaven:</hi> that is, in ſuch ſort, as he which for the gift ſpoken of before, is fit to leade a ſingle life.</p>
                     <p>As therefore by theſe things he may with leſſe hinderance and more eaſily, and readily with great leaſure, and more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly imploy his labour to the ſalvation of the Church and holy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, even ſo he may be a more convenient Miniſter then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of the ſame ſalvation, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for him:
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:61072:233"/> (and whereof that he may be partaker by faith, it is given him freely of grace, and wherein he doth keep and uphold himſelfe) ſeeing that it is certian, that by the ſtate of marriage many lets, many cares, and many things whereby neceſſarie quietneſſe is diſturbed, are caſt in our way. And this is it which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>would that you ſhould be without ſuch cares. He that is unmarried, is carefull for thoſe things which pertain to the Lord, how he may pleaſe the Lord.</hi> Alſo, <hi>I thinke that this is good for the preſent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</hi> Alſo, to that which is ſeemely to performe diligence, by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord without diſtraction. And before we rehearſed the voyce of the Lord who ſaith, <hi>that there be ſome, who for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, doe abſtaine from marriage.</hi> And holy <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that giveth not his virgin to be married, doth the better.</hi> For which cauſe it is taught, that all they, who of their owne accord doe take and chuſe unto themſelves this kinde of life, ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to have regard hereunto, that in ſuch a life they may with a ſingular and earneſt endevour exerciſe godlineſſe, and be holy, as <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth, as well in body, as in ſpirit, and give more light then others, by the honeſty of their actions, by the labours of ſuch trades as beſeem a Chriſtian profeſſion, by doing all that they can for the benefit of the Church, and by yeelding their ſervice to the ſick, and to other needy members.</p>
                     <p>This gift and purpoſe of ſuch which doe thus in this matter conſecrate themſelves to God, and ſuch an exerciſe of their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, is commended of our men, and they doe faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men hereunto: but they doe perſwade, as we ſaid, and not compell: the which thing <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth, who writeth thus: <hi>Concerning Virgins I have no commandement of the Lord, but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver</hi>

Notwithſtanding, if for this cauſe he ſhould be contemned, which the Church cannot do without ſinne, it were certainly better for him, by this means to preſerve his ſoule, (although he ſhould be one of the common ſort of Chriſtians onely) then by perſiſting in his miniſterie with ſinne, to looſe and condemne it.</p>
                     <p>But although it ſeemeth to come neerer to the example of the Primitive Church, that worthy and honeſt married men may be choſen to take the charge of ſouls in the Church, then to give them leave to change their kinde of life, who before being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, did labour diligently in the miniſtery of the Lord, yet notwithſtanding our men doe not ground the worthineſſe, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and vertue of the Eccleſiaſtical miniſtery, no more then they do of Chriſtian ſalvation, upon either of theſe kinds, ro wit, neither upon the ſtate of ſingle life, nor of wedlocke: neither is there any other thing ſought or looked for (as it is before declared) more then that onely profit, and opportunitie, which falleth into a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, and is commended of the holy Ghoſt. After theſe things they doe thus conſequently teach touching wedlocke, that ſuch a condition of life, though it have many difficulties, puniſhments, and curſes joyned with it, where with after the fall of man, both mankinde, and this order is oppreſſed, yet that it is in this wiſe holy, and acceptable unto God, becauſe that God himſelfe did in the beginning ordaine it, and afterward Chriſt our Lord did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate it, and doth daily conſecrate it in thoſe that are his, and that
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:61072:234"/> in ſuch ſort, that their children alſo be holy, and that moreover God hath offered unto it peculiarly ſingular promiſes, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which are contained in the Scriptures. Thence therefore muſt all true Chriſtians know, that whoſoever doe chuſe this kinde of life ſo as it becometh them, and with an upright purpoſe doe both give themſelves thereunto, and be converſant therein, they doe not onely not ſinne, but they doe, and accompliſh that, which God would have them to doe: and that they leade ſuch a kinde of life, as God doth peculiarly call ſome unto, and that they doe ſerve the ſelfe ſame Lord, whom the unmarried men doe ſerve.</p>

                     <p>VVHereas the Doctrine of Chriſt maketh honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of marriage, and willeth men to uſe the ſame, not onely for procreation ſake, but alſo to bridle and avoyd luſts: now a dayes the marriages of Prieſts are not onely by the Popes law, but alſo by a new and unwonted crueltie forbidden, and ſuch as be made and contracted, are diſſolved and broken. Which is ſo much the more unſeemely, for that theſe things are done in the Church, which, as ſhe ought moſt of all to abhorre and deteſt filthineſſe, ſo ſhould ſhe with great care defend wedlocke, for the avoiding of many grievous enormities. Beſides, ſeeing that in all heatheniſh Common-wealthes that were but meanely well ordered, marriage was in great account, for very waightie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; what is there leſſe ſeemely in the Church, then either to breake in ſunder the moſt holy knot of wedlocke, or to puniſh marriage with puniſhments of death, as though it were a moſt hainous offence? Whence is it, that this crueltie hath ſpread it ſelfe into the Church, in which mutuall love ſhould flouriſh moſt of all? Moreover the matter it ſelf doth teſtifie how much beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and how many villanies this popiſh law of ſingle life doth bring forth: no voice of man is able to ſhew, how many vices have iſſued forth of this fountaine into the Church. For (to ſay nothing of Epicures, who bluſh at nothing) how many good and godly men have had ill ſucceſſe in ſtriving with their naturall weakneſſe, and at the laſt have fallen into horrible deſpaire? Now whereto tendeth this new crueltie, but that thoſe innumerable villanies might be confirmed in the Churches, and that wicked men might ſinne more freely? This matter needeth no diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all. For this new law defended by our Adverſaries, which forbiddeth Prieſts to marry, and diſſolveth thoſe that are contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is flat contrary to the law of nature, to the law of God, to the Goſpell, to the conſtitutions of ancient Synods, and to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the ancient Church. Onely in this calling we need the godlineſſe and equitie of the moſt excellent Emperour, whom we beſeech for his godlineſſe and duties ſake that he would ſeeke ſome remedie for the Church by aboliſhing this tyrannicall law.
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:61072:235"/> For as all unjuſt crueltie doth diſpleaſe God, ſo that moſt of all, which is exerciſed againſt godly and learned Prieſts, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well of the Church.</p>
                     <p>And in this caſe we have not onely the word of God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning moſt grievous plagues againſt them, which exerciſe crueltie on the Prieſts, but alſo there are examples to be ſeene in all ages which doe plainly teſtifie, that ſuch threatnings are not in vaine. For to let paſſe infinite other examples, the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin</hi> was almoſt quite deſtroyed, for abuſing the Prieſts wife that came thither as a ſtranger. For when as the dead body of the woman, which died after ſhe had been ſo abuſed, was cut in pieces, and ſent to all the Princes of Iſrael, all the people judged that ſuch outrage ought moſt ſeverely to be revenged. And when they could not get the authors of this ſhamefull fact to be delivered unto them, for to be puniſhed, the whole Tribe of <hi>Beniamin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a great overthrow, was puniſhed for it. Now in theſe dayes the Prieſts are vexed with ſundry injuries: they are (when no other crime is objected unto them but marriage) racked with moſt horrible torments, and ſo put to death, their miſerable wives and little children, being throwne out of houſe and home, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up and downe, as baniſhed perſons, without any certaine place of abode, or houſe to dwell in. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>The forbidding of marriage the doctrine of Devils:</hi> which to be true, not onely theſe filthy vices, which the ſingle life hath brought into the Church, but alſo the crueltie, which by reaſon of this law is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon Prieſts, and their wives and children, doe teſtifie plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the Devill is a murtherer, and he is chiefly delighted with the miſeries of the godly. But the deviſers of ſuch counſell ſhall one day have their juſt reward from God. We judge that ſuch crueltie is not worthy for Chriſtians to uſe, nor profitable to the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>Whereas they object the authoritie of the Popes law, why doe they not alledge the authoritie of the Canons againſt thoſe ſhamefull examples of uncleane ſingle life, and thoſe villanies, that were worthy of moſt ſevere puniſhment? The authoritie of the Popes decree, which is contrary to the law of nature, and the commandement of God, ſhould be of no waight. Men are ſo made by nature, that they ſhould be fruitfull. Whereupon the Lawyers ſay, <hi>That the coniunction of man &amp; woman is by the law of nature.</hi> And the ſame the firſt book of <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth in the firſt
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:61072:236"/> and ſecond Chapters. Againe, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To avoide fornication, let every man have his wife,</hi> it is certaine, that he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all which are not apt for a ſingle life, to joyne in marriage. And Chriſt doth admoniſh, that all are not fit for a ſingle life, when he ſaith, <hi>All men doe not receive this thing.</hi> Moreover, neither mens laws, nor any vows, are of force, which are againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God. And the event it ſelfe doth teſtifie, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be changed by mans law. For we ſee what vile fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe this ſingle life doth bring forth, and if there be any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men which endeavour to keepe themſelves chaſte, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive right well how great a burden, how great danger there is in this thing, and they doe eſpecially be waile this ſlavery of their order.</p>
                     <p>Certaine men went about in the Nicene Synod to make a law to forbid Prieſts the uſe of their wives. This law was reſuſed by the holy Synod: and the Latine Churches in the old time was not ſo ſevere in this point: for they did put from the miniſtery onely ſuch, as when they had taken upon them any Eccleſiaſticall functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did afterwards marry wives, yet they did not forbid marriage. But this is a new law of the Pope, unknowne to the ancient Churches and Synods, which doth wholly forbid marriages, and breaketh of ſuch as are contracted. But it is evident, that either part of this decree is flat contrary to the Goſpell. They alledge againſt us the authoritie of the Church, and of Synodes, which the Popes themſelves that were Authors of this decree, did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently contemne, and godly Prieſts did evidently withſtand this new law. For the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories doe teſtifie, that it was never layed upon the Churches, without great contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reſiſtance. The Biſhop of Tarracon writeth to <hi>Syricius</hi> the Pope, <hi>That the Prieſts of Spaine could not be brought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that law which forbad them the uſe of their wives.</hi> What a ſtirre doth <hi>Syricius</hi> keepe there? How ſharply doth he write? For theſe are the words of <hi>Syricius,</hi> which are unmeet for a Pope: <hi>Let him tell me, whoſoever he be, a hunter after luſts, and a Maſter of vices.</hi> And thereupon he wreſteth the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to his cauſe, which are moſt farre from it: <hi>They which live in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> A man may doubt ſurely, whether it may better be attributed to his ignorance, or his impudencie, that he ſpeaks ſo diſdainfully of marriage. For he goeth about nothing elſe but to forbid Prieſts the uſe of their wives, which then they had married.</p>
                     <pb n="433" facs="tcp:61072:236"/>
                     <p>But the Popes that ſucceeded after were yet more hard and cruell. When the Archbiſhop of Mentz did in a Synode rehearſe the Popes decree touching the putting away of wives in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the Prieſts were ſo kindled in their anger that they threatned to ſet upon the Archbiſhop himſelfe. And it was in deed both an unworthy, and cruell thing, to put away their wives, which they then had. But at laſt either force, or ſuperſtition got the upper hand. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was farre more equall and gentle to ſuch women as had not kept their vowed chaſtitie. For he writeth in the firſt booke, the 11. Epiſt. <hi>If they will not, or cannot indure it, it is better they ſhould marry, then that they ſhould fall into the fire through their importune luſts. In any wiſe let them give no offence to the brethren or ſiſters.</hi> Beſides this, unjuſt laws are not wont to be perpetuall. We doe therefore intreat the moſt excellent Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that among many other enormities of the Church, he will alſo conſider the faults of this law: in which caſe that alſo is to be weighed. The nature of man doth as it were waxe old, and is become weaker. Wherefore there muſt be care had that vices doe not increaſe: Neither muſt the laws themſelves be ſeeds of vices. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith very wiſely, that <hi>Laws muſt be made for vertues ſake.</hi> Now whether this tradition of ſingle life be maintained for pieties ſake, or for ſome other purpoſe, it is no hard matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. Laſt of all, ſeeing that Chriſt hath eſpecially commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the care of the Miniſters of the Goſpell to the godly, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire therefore that the moſt excellent Emperour would reſtraine this crueltie, which hath a long time been exerciſed upon godly Prieſts, and would rather conſult with the Church, then with our Adverſaries, in that behalfe. Surely love and mercifull dealing ſhould flouriſh in the Church. Wherefore the true Church doth greatly abhorre unneceſſary crueltie, and would not have the Prieſts put to death for a tyrannicall tradition. Shee would alſo have the poore Wives and Children of Prieſts favourably dealt with. All whoſe lives and ſafetie the Church doth commend unto thee, O moſt mercifull Emperour. All the godly where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, are touched with their miſeries and doe in heart deſire Chriſtian lenitie in this behalfe, and doe alſo with teares joyntly commend learned and honeſt men that are profitable to the Church together with their wives and children, unto thee, whom they ſee both to be indued with an excellent and heroicall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and kindneſſe, and alſo to have uſed in this cauſe very nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:61072:237"/> moderation, which doth let us underſtand that thou art care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of bringing ſome remedy unto the Common-wealth. The Church would not have thee to be a Miniſter of another mans crueltie. The greateſt honour of Kings is that which <hi>Eſay</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to them when he ſaith, that <hi>they ſhould be nurſe fathers to the Church:</hi> that is, that kingdomes and the maintenance of peace and of humane ſocietie ſhould not only ſerve for the profit of the body, but alſo ſhould further the Goſpell, namely, when as they both rule the Prieſts, and alſo grant peace and quietneſſe in cities, that the youth might be trained up in religion, and men might be inſtructed. The Church therefore doth beſeech thee to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the care of defending the godly Prieſts, as of certaine nourſlings, lyeth upon thee. It belongeth unto this calling to be a ſuccour for innocencie, to ſave from injuries, eſpecially ſuch as are weake, which are not able to defend themſelves, as namely, godly women, children, and orphanes or the fatherleſſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which you may well thinke that the wives and children of Prieſts, which are right orphanes in deed, are left unto your charge by the Lord. The Church, as moſt full of naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and love, doth not onely approve of the mutuall love of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed folks one to another, and of the love of parents to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but is alſo touched with the miſeries of thoſe that are forlorne and fatherleſſe. And ſurely ſhee judgeth in ſo great goodneſſe of your nature that there is no inhumanitie or want of naturall affection. VVherefore ſhee is in good hope that the murders, and executions of Prieſts, and the baniſhment of their wives and children doe grieve thee not a little. The Church alſo doth give thee warning to look to it, leſt many points of Chriſtian doctrine, the unfolding and laying open whereof is very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, be ſmothered up, whiles godly and learned Miniſters are put to death, and whiles men are driven from the ſtudy of Chriſtian doctrin. What elſe do our Adverſaries ſeek, but that all good learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and true doctrin may be rooted out or oppreſſed, and men may only depend upon the authoritie of ſuch as do beare rule, and that they might eſteeme the dreams of unlearned men, though never ſo impious, never ſo abſurd, for oracles. Our Adverſaries imagine that this barbarous bondage is the beſt, and ſureſt for their Lordly rule. And in deed it is very evident, how the Church in many places is oppreſſed with this bondage. Now though libertie may not be granted to diſanull ſuch determinations, as be received by
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:61072:237"/> good authoritie, and though men ought not to depart either from the Scriptures, or from the decrees of the ancient Synods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have determined of Chriſtian doctrine, yet is it not meet that the authoritie of the Church ſhould be pretended for all ſuch abuſes and faults, as the latter and worſer age hath brought into the Church. And ſurely men doe flatter and deceive themſelves too much, if they thinke that there be no faults conveighed into the Church by the deſires of covetous men, and by thoſe Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes and obſcurities, of the doctrine and traditions of the Schoolemen. For now adaies good men are not ſo much in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for their marriage ſake, as for their care and deſire they have to purge and bring to triall the doctrine of Chriſt. Which care the Biſhops ought wiſely to direct and further. For to them eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is the care of ſetting forth the maintenance of true doctrine commended: they ſhould be the Ringleaders and furtherers of this moſt holy and fruitfull care and ſtudy. But it belongeth not to the Biſhop alone but alſo to godly Princes, and eſpecially to the Emperour, to underſtand the Goſpell purely, to judge of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be warie and watchfull that no wicked opinions be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or rooted: and to aboliſh Idolatry with all his might and main.</p>
                     <p>By theſe and ſuch like duties did many valiant and notable men deſerve well at the hands of godly men, as <hi>Gedeon, Ezechias, Ioſias,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and ſundry others. Wherefore you muſt thinke it your dutie alſo to take heed, leſt ſuch things, as be godly and profitably brought to light and reformed by God and learned men, be ſmoothered againe, and leſt that wicked abuſes be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by your authoritie. The Pſalme ſaith, <hi>for thy temples ſake in Ieruſalem, the King ſhall offer gifts unto thee.</hi> The proper gifts that Kings are to beſtow upon the Church are, to ſearch out true doctrine, and to ſee that good teachers be ſet over the Churches, to give diligence that the controverſies of the Church may be rightly decided: Not to take away true and holy doctrine, but to raiſe it up, and to ſet it forward, and to defend it, and rightly to ſet it in order, and to maintaine the quiet concord of the Church. By theſe true gifts, moſt noble Emperour, you may adorne the Church of Chriſt, which eſpecially both Chriſt himſelf requireth, and the Churches, that are rent and torne in moſt horrible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, doe crave at your hands.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, ſeeing that humane traditions ought to give place to times and opportunities, eſpecially in the Church, wherein
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61072:238"/> there ſhould be more regard had of the ſalvation of the godly, and of love, and publike peace, then of any humane traditions, it were a great deale better to make ſhew of abrogating this ſilly tradition of ſingle life, then to ſtrengthen luſts, to diſſolve marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, to exerciſe crueltie againſt the Prieſts and their wives and chidren, to oppreſſe true and holy doctrine, and to make havocke of the Church. We do therefore commend this matter of their marriage unto your piety and bountie, O noble Emperour, as that which hath no difficultie or doubtfulneſſe in it. For they that be governours both may and ought to aboliſh an unjuſt law. And the laws of ſingle life, whether they be new, or old, belong only to humane equitie, in mitigating whereof the authoritie of the Church ſhould be of great force. We could bring very many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples out of the Hiſtories of all times and countries, in which there might be ſeene horrible examples of judgements, which followed upon uncleane luſts. Among many other cauſes of the generall flood, there is mention made of fleſhly luſts. Afterward five cities were ſwallowed up in an opening of the earth, ſo as the lake called Aſphalites was left as a perpetuall monument of that puniſhment: when the Iſraelites were departed out of Egypt, and divers had defiled themſelves by going in unto Moabitiſh women, the twelve Princes of the tribes were hanged up, and twentie foure thouſand men were ſlaine. The Cananites after this were cleane rooted out, and among the cauſes thereof, ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous copulations are namely reckoned up: ſhortly after follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the overthrow of the tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> for abuſing the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites wife. After this <hi>David</hi> was driven out of his kingdome for adultery. And <hi>Ieremie</hi> in divers places cryeth out, that theſe three, idolatry, oppreſſions, and adulteries, are the cauſes of thoſe great calamities, which overwhelmed the whole nation of the Iews then, when they were carried captives to Babylon. Theſe things are written for this purpoſe, that we might know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God is diſpleaſed with wandring luſts of uncleanneſſe: and that uncleane and inceſtuous perſons do not fall into puniſhments by chance, but are puniſhed of God. Therefore the deſtructions of heatheniſh Cities alſo doe put us in minde of the wrath of God againſt theſe villanies. <hi>Sibaris</hi> was overthrowne: <hi>Athens, Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi> being toſſed with civill warres, received due puniſhment of their filthineſſe. And Rome when it brought forth many <hi>Neroes</hi> and <hi>Heliogabales,</hi> at length it came to ruine,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61072:238"/> the Empire being rent into ſundry parts by the warres of ſundry barbarous nations. There is alſo a long Catalogue in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> of cities, wherein there happened changes of government and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for uncleane luſts. Beſides all which puniſhments <hi>Paul</hi> warneth the Church that there is another judgement that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon theſe luſts, and that is madneſſe, or fury, as it is written. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4. And it may well be, that this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath ſeaſed upon our Eccleſiaſticall governours, who for the moſt part are open Epicures, open defenders of Idols, that they may get wealth and authoritie, and ſcoffe at thoſe heavenly ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which threaten vengeance upon Idolaters, uncleane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Parricides. They vaunt that they doe all things well, which they do for their kingdomes ſake, and that ſuch are good ſubjects, and love quietneſſe and peace, that allow of errours and open naughtineſſe, that they may uphold the Majeſtie of the Popes kingdome. The whole world can beare witneſſe that there is a God that doth revenge all filthineſſe, uncleanneſſe, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Wherefore though they now deride and ſcoffe at theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet let them know, that they ſhall one day ſtick faſt in thoſe puniſhments, whereunto the world it ſelfe doth call them.</p>
                     <p>Seeing then it is a cleare caſe, that the law of ſingle life is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the commandement of God, we thinke that the Prieſts and others do very well, which joyne in honeſt marriage, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>a Biſhop muſt be choſen that is the husband of one wife.</hi> We judge alſo that the Rulers both may, and ought to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this law of the Pope. For they are foulely deceived, that think either that marriage is forbidden to Prieſts by Gods law, or elſe that the Kings or Biſhops may make a law to forbid them marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. And if that Rulers will not helpe the Church in this behalfe, yet the godly doe well which follow the Apoſtles rule, which ſaith, <hi>That we muſt rather obey God, then men.</hi> To conclude ſeeing the defence of the Popes law hath many faults joyned with it, as namely, the ſtrengthning of wandring luſts, ſuperſtitions, and murdering of godly Prieſts, every one may ſee that our Churches deale well in aboliſhing and condemning that law of the Pope. And we beſeech the moſt renowned Emperour, that he will not defile himſelfe, with defending that uncleane ſingle life, and with the blood of the Prieſts: for it is written, <hi>Bleſſed is he that hath pitie on the poore and needy, the Lord ſhall deliver him in the evill day.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>THere was a common complaint of the examples of ſuch Prieſts, as were not continent. For which cauſe alſo Pope <hi>Pius</hi> is reported to have ſaid, that <hi>there were certaine cauſes for which marriage was forbidden to Prieſts, but there were many weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier cauſes why it ſhould be permitted again.</hi> For ſo <hi>Platina</hi> writeth. When as therefore the Prieſts among us fought to avoyd theſe publike offences, they married wives, and taught that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for themſelves to joyn in marriage. Firſt, becauſe that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To avoide fornication, let every man have his wife.</hi> Again, <hi>It is better to marry then to burn.</hi> Secondly Chriſt ſaith, <hi>All men do not receive this word:</hi> where he ſheweth that all men are not fit for a ſingle life, becauſe that God created man for procreations ſake. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. It is not in mans power, without a ſpeciall gift and worke of God, to alter his creation. Therefore ſuch as are not meet for a ſingle life, ought to joyne in Matrimony. For no law of man, no vow can take away the commandement of God and his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. By theſe reaſons our Prieſts do prove that they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully marry wives. And it is well known, that in the ancient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Prieſts were married. For <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>a Biſhop muſt be choſen which is a husband.</hi> And in Germanie about 400. yeers ago, the Prieſts were by violence compelled to live a ſingle life, who then were ſo wholly bent againſt the matter, that the Archbiſhop of Mentz, being to publiſh the Pope of Rome his decree in that behalfe, was almoſt murdered in a tumult by the Prieſts in their anger. And the matter was handled ſo contrary to law, that they did not only forbid marriages for the time to come, but alſo ſuch as were then contracted, contrary to all laws divine and humane, contrary to the Canons themſelves, that were before made not onely by Popes, but alſo by moſt famous Councels. And ſeeing that the world decaying, mans nature by little and little waxeth weaker, it is behoovefull to looke well to it, that no more vices doe overſpread Germanie.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, God ordained marriage to be a remedie for mans infirmitie. The Canons themſelves doe ſay, that <hi>the old
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:61072:239"/> rigour is now and then in latter times to be releaſed for the weakneſſe of men.</hi> Which it were to be wiſhed might be done in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo. It is very like that if marriage be forbidden any longer, we ſhall at length want Paſtours in the Church. Seeing then that there is a plaine commandement of God, ſeeing the uſe of the Church is well knowne, ſeeing that the impure ſingle life bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth very many offences, adulteries, and other enormities worthy to be puniſhed by the godly Magiſtrate, yet it is a marvell, that greater crueltie ſhould be ſhewed in no other thing, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the marriage of Prieſts. God hath commanded to honour marriage: the laws in all well ordered Common-wealths, even among the heathen alſo have adorned marriages with very great priviledges. But now men are cruelly put to death, yea and Prieſts alſo, contrary to the minde of the Canons, for no other cauſe, but onely for marriage. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth that <hi>a doctrine of devils</hi> which forbiddeth marriage. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. which may now very well be ſeene, when as the forbidding of marriage is maintained by ſuch puniſhments. But as no law of man can take away the law of God, no more can any vow whatſoever. Therefore <hi>Cyprian</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth counſell, that thoſe women ſhould marry, which do not keep their vowed chaſtity. His words are theſe in the firſt book, the 11. Epiſt. <hi>If they will not, or are not able to indure, it is farre better they ſhould marry, then that they ſhould fall into the fire by their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune deſire. In any wiſe let them give no offence to their brethren or ſiſters.</hi> Yea and the Canons uſe a kinde of equitie towards ſuch, as before their ripe yeers did vow chaſtitie, as hitherto the uſe hath been.</p>

                     <p>VVHat is taught amongſt us, touching the vowes of Monks ſhall be better underſtood, if you call to minde what was the ſtate of Monaſteries, and how many things were every day committed in the Monaſteries, contrary to the Canons. In <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time Colledges were free, but afterward, when diſcipline was corrupted, every where vowes were laid upon them, that as it were by a new deviſed priſon, the diſcipline might be reſtored again. Over and beſides vows by little and little many other obſervations were added. And theſe bands and ſnares were caſt upon many, before they came to ripe yeeres, contrary
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:61072:240"/> to the Canons. Many through errour fell into this kind of life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, who though they wanted no yeers, yet they wanted diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to judge of their ſtrength and abilitie. They which were once got within theſe ſnares, were conſtrained to abide in them, though by the benefit of the Canon, ſome might be ſet at libertie. And that fell out rather in the Nunneries, then in the Colledges of Monks, becauſe the weaker ſexe was more to be ſpared. This ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſeveritie miſliked many good men heretofore, when they ſaw young maides and young men thruſt up into Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there to get their living, and ſaw what an unhappie ſucceſſe this counſell had, what offences it bred, and what ſnares it laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens conſciences. They were grieved that the authoritie of the Canons was wholly neglected and contemned in a thing moſt dangerous. To all theſe evils there was added, ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of vows, which as it is well known, did in former times miſlike the Monks themſelves, if any of them were ſome what ſtouter then the reſt. They taught forſooth that vows were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to Baptiſme: touching ſingle life, they taught that it meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted remiſſion of ſins, and juſtification before God: yea farther, that the Monks life did not onely merit righteouſneſſe before God, but more then that, becauſe it obſerved, not onely the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but alſo the Counſels in the Goſpel. And thus they taught, that the Monks profeſſion was better then Baptiſme, that the Monks life did merit more, then the life of Magiſtrates, of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and ſuch like, which in the obedience of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followed their calling, without any ſuch religion of mans making. None of theſe things can be denied, they are to be ſeene in their writings. What fell out afterward in the Monaſteries? In old time there were Schooles for the ſtudy of Divinitie, and other Arts, which were profitable to the Church, and thence were Paſtours and Biſhops taken. But now the caſe is altered. It is needleſſe to rehearſe their vows. In old time they came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into ſuch places to learne, but now they feigne, that it is a kinde of life taken up to merit remiſſion of ſinnes and juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yea they ſay, it is a ſtate of perfection, and preferre it to all other kinde of lifes that God ordained. We have therefore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned theſe things, amplifying nothing odiouſly, to the end that the doctrine of our men touching this matter might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, touching ſuch as joyne in marriage, thus they teach with
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:61072:240"/> us, that it is lawfull for any to marry, that is not fit for a ſingle life: for as much as vows cannot take away Gods ordinance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. The commandement of God is, <hi>To avoid fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let every man have his wife.</hi> And not onely the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo the creation and ordinance of God, compelleth ſuch unto marriage, as without the ſpeciall work of God are not exempted, according to that ſaying, <hi>It is not good for man to be alone.</hi> They therefore that are obedient to this commandement and ordinance of God doe not offend. What can be ſaid againſt theſe things? Let a man amplifie the bond of a vow, as much as he will, yet can he never bring to paſſe that the vow ſhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Gods Commandement. The Canons teach, <hi>That in every vow the right of the ſuperiour is excepted:</hi> much leſſe therefore can theſe vowes, which are contrary to Gods Commandement, be of force. If ſo be that the bond of vowes had no cauſe why it might be changed, then ſhould not the Roman Biſhops have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed there with. For indeed it is not lawfull for man to diſanull that bond, which doth ſimply belong to the law of God. But the Roman Biſhops have judged very wiſely, that in this bond there muſt an equitie be uſed: therefore they are often read to have diſpenſed with vowes. The hiſtorie of the King of Arragon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called back out of a Monaſterie, is well known, and there be many examples of our time.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, why do our adverſaries exaggerate the bond, or the effect of the vow, when as in the meane time they ſpeake not a word of the very nature of a vow, which ought to be in a thing poſſible, which ought to be voluntarie, and taken up of a mans owne accord, and with advice or deliberation. But it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, how perpetuall chaſtitie is in the power of a man. And how many amongſt them is there, that doth vow of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and with advice? Wenches and young maides, before they know how to judge, are perſwaded, yea ſometimes alſo compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to vow; wherefore it is not meet to diſpute ſo rigorouſly of the bond, ſeeing that all men confeſſe, that it is againſt the nature of a vow, which is not done of a mans own accord, or unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Canons for the moſt part doe diſanull vowes, <hi>which are made before one be fifteene yeeres of age, becauſe that before one come to that age, he ſeemeth not to have ſo much iudgement, as to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of a perpetuall life.</hi> Another Canon permitting more to the weakneſſe of men, doth adde ſome yeeres moe, <hi>for it forbiddeth
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:61072:241"/> a vow to be made, before one be 18. yeeres of age.</hi> But whether of theſe ſhall we follow? the greateſt part hath this excuſe, why they forſake Monaſteries, becauſe that for the moſt part they wowed before they came to this age.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all, although the breaking of a vow may be reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet it followeth not, that the marriages of ſuch perſons are to be diſſolved. For <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 27. <hi>queſt. 1. cap,</hi> of Marriages, <hi>doth deny that they ought to be diſſolved:</hi> and his authoritie is not lightly to be eſteemed, although others afterward have thought otherwiſe. And although the commandement of God, touching wedlock, doth free moſt men from vows, yet our men doe alſo bring another reaſon concerning vows, that they be fruſtrate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that all the worſhip of God, inſtituted of men without the commandement of God, and choſen to merit remiſſion of ſinnes and juſtification, is wicked, as Chriſt ſaith: <hi>They do in vain worſhip me with the commandements of men.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> doth every where teach, that righteouſneſſe is not to be ſought, out of our obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thoſe worſhips, which are deviſed by men, but that it cometh by faith to thoſe that beleeve that they have God pacified and reconciled to them for Chriſt, not for any of their merits. But it is evident that the Monks did teach, <hi>that theſe made or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited religions do deſerve remiſsion of ſins and iuſtification, and that they do ſatisfie for ſins.</hi> What elſe is this, then to detract from the glory of Chriſt, and to obſcure, and deny the righteouſneſſe of faith? wherefore it followeth, that theſe vowes thus uſed were wicked worſhips, and therefore they be of no value. For a wicked vow, and that which is made againſt the commandement of God is of no force, <hi>neither ought a vow to be a bond of iniquitie,</hi> as the Canon ſaith, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye are made voyd of Chriſt, which ſeeke to be iuſtified by the law, ye are fallen from grace:</hi> that is, they which do think, that by their own works they do merit remiſſion of ſinnes, and that they do pleaſe God for their own fulfilling of the law, and do not perceive, that for Chriſt his ſake they do freely receive by faith the remiſſion of their ſinnes, through the mercy of God, and that they do pleaſe God through Chriſt, they do looſe Chriſt, becauſe they doe transferre the confidence which is due to Chriſt, and to the promiſe of God unto works. Alſo they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the wrath of God, not Chriſt the propitiatour, but their owne works, therefore they doe transferre the honour, which is due unto Chriſt, unto our works. Now it is manifeſt that the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:61072:241"/> Monks doe teach this, that by their obſervations they do deſerve remiſſion of ſinnes, becauſe they finde God mercifull unto them for theſe obſervations. Wherefore they teach men to truſt to their owne works, not to the propitiation of Chriſt. This is a wicked confidence, and is contrary to the Goſpel, and in the judgement of God it ſhall be found to be vaine. For our workes cannot be oppoſed to the wrath and judgement of God: the wrath of God is then onely appeaſed, when as we do by faith lay hold upon the free mercy, promiſed for Chriſts ſake. Therefore they loſe Chriſt, which place their confidence, not in Chriſt, but in their own works.</p>
                     <p>Moreover the Monks have taught, that their kinde of life is a ſtate of perfection, becauſe they did obſerve not onely the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, but alſo the counſels. This error is chiefly contrary to the Goſpel, becauſe they have feigned that they do ſo ſatisfie the commandements, as that they can alſo do ſomewhat more: and hereupon aroſe that horrible errour which they have feigned, that they had merits of ſupererogation. Theſe they have applied for others, that they might be ſatisfections for other mens ſins. If any man will odiouſly exaggerate theſe things how many things might he rehearſe, whereof the Monks themſelves are now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? It is no light offence, in the Church to propound unto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> people a certain worſhip deviſed by men, without the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, and to teach, that ſuch a worſhip doth juſtifie men: becauſe that the righteouſneſſe of faith in Chriſt, which ought eſpecially to be taught in the Church, is obſcured, when as thoſe marvellous religions of Angels, feigning of poverty, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and of ſingle life, are caſt before mens eyes. Moreover the commandements of God &amp; the true worſhip of God are obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when men hear, that Monks alone are in that ſtate of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: becauſe that Chriſtian perfection is this, to feare God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and again to conceive great faith, and to truſt aſſuredly, that God is pacified toward us for Chriſt his ſake, to aske, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look for help from God in all our affaires, according to our calling: and outwardly to do good works diligently, and to tend upon our vocation. In theſe things doth true perfection and the true worſhip of God conſiſt: it doth not conſiſt in ſingleneſſe of life, in beggarie, or in vile apparell.</p>
                     <p>The people alſo doth conceive many pernicious opinions of thoſe falſe commendations of the Monaſticall life. They heare
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:61072:242"/> that ſingle life is praiſed above meaſure, therefore they live in marriage with offence of conſcience. They heare that beggers onely are perfect, therefore they keep their poſſeſſions, and buy and ſell with offence of conſcience. They heare that the Goſpel giveth counſell, not to revenge: therefore ſome that lead a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life are not afraid to revenge themſelves: For they heare that it is a counſell, not a commandement. Others do thinke that all Magiſtracie and civill offices are unworthy a Chriſtian man. We read examples of men, who forſaking wedlock, and leaving the government of the common wealth, have hid themſelves in Monaſteries. That they called, to flie out of the world, and to ſeek a kinde of life, which is more acceptable to God: neither did they ſee, that God is to be ſerved in thoſe commandements, which he himſelfe hath delivered, not in the commandements, which are deviſed by men. That is a good and perfect kinde of life, which hath the commandement of God for it warrant. It is neceſſary to admoniſh men of theſe things. And before theſe times <hi>Gerſon</hi> did reprehend this errour of the perfections of Monks, and he witneſſeth, <hi>that in his time this was a new or ſtrange voice, that the Monaſticall life is a ſtate of perfection.</hi> Thus many wicked opinions doe cleave faſt unto vowes, as that they merit remiſſion of ſinnes and juſtification, that they are Chriſtian perfection, that they do keep the counſels and commandements, that they have works of ſupererogation. All theſe things, ſeeing they be falſe and vaine, do make vowes to be of none effect.</p>

For the Church doth know, that God doth moſt ſeverely forbid wandring luſts amongſt mankind, and that he would have chaſtitie ſo to be underſtood, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as he himſelfe hath ordained it, that we alſo may know, that he is a pure and a chaſte minde, and may diſcerne him from devils, who through the hatred they beare to God, are delighted with the confuſions of luſts, and doe drive forward this weake nature of man, that it may be horribly defiled. Wherefore both the Heathen did every where admit certain foule examples, and Heretikes at all times have ſpread abroad monſtrous opinions
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:61072:242"/> touching wedlock, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doe declare. And the Turkiſh manner, and the lawes of the Pope, concerning ſingle life, have cauſed a great deformitie in this laſt old age of the world. But <hi>Paul</hi> doth affirme, that it is a ſigne of evill Spirits, to forbid marriage.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore we do very carefully keep the ſincere doctrine of God touching marriage, and by the mercy of God our civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates have appointed, and doe defend judgements for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage matters in their government, and they do ſeverely puniſh thoſe wicked deeds which are contrary to the law of God, and know that by the commandement of God they are injoyned to have a care to defend chaſtitie, and wedlocke. And we detaine this true definition, agreeing with the commandements of God, and the cuſtome of the Apoſtolique Church. Marriage is a lawfull and indiſſoluble conjunction, onely of one man and of one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to be kept becauſe of the commandement of God, who by this meane will have mankinde aſſociated, chaſtitie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and luſts not to wander. God in the beginning did conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate this order, ſaying thus, <hi>They ſhall be two in one fleſh,</hi> to wit, one man, and one onely woman inſeparably joyned together. And againe, this firſt law was eſtabliſhed of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. Now that this coupling together may be lawfull, we doe immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably obſerve the differences of perſons, that we may not make a mixture of thoſe perſons, who by the law of God are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to couple together. <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. Obſervation upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> Alſo we keepe the rules of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non law, touching other neerer degrees, as there be ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be ſeene delivered with grave and wiſe deliberation in our Conſiſtories.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, we know it is the will of God, that marriage ſhould not be forbidden to any perſons, that be fit thereunto, and which, without marriage, could not live without danger of their conſcience, as it is written, <hi>Gen. 2. Matth. 19. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we give leave to Prieſts and other perſons, to marrie, which had rather live godly in marriage, then in a ſingle life to have wounded conſciences, ſo that they may not invocate God, and live holily. In affiances, even according to the ancient lawes, we will have the conſent of Parents alſo, ſeeing that Parents are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a probable reaſon. Touching divorcements, this rule is moſt firmely held, that they doe ſinne, who either by adulterie, or by forſaking, be the firſt cauſe of diſtraction: and adulterers
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:61072:243"/> and adultereſſes, and he and ſhe that doth forſake the other, are condemned by the voyce of them that preach in our Churches, and of the Iudges in our Conſiſtories, and they be ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of our Magiſtrates. But the innocent perſon (when as the matter being well known, he is ſet free) is not forbid to marrie, that he may invocate God, and live holily. For ſeeing that the Lord doth expreſſely ſet at libertie the innocent perſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. when as the other partie is polluted with adulterie, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a ſetting at libertie, not in name onely, but in deed. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh after the ſame manner, in the caſe of forſaking. This our cuſtome doth alſo agree with the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church. The other lawes which we have in our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. Obſervat.</note> doe agree with the Canon law: and we doe truely propound unto the people the whole doctrine touching marriage and chaſtitie.</p>
                     <p>We affirme, that all commixtions, and ſpilling of the ſeed without marriage, are ſinnes condemned of God, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. obſervation.</note> as mortall ſinnes, and ſuch as drive out of men the holy Ghoſt, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grievous puniſhments are ſpread throughout mankinde, by reaſon of luſts, as it is written, <hi>Fornicatours and adulterers God will iudge.</hi> And there is a threatning of theſe puniſhments ſet down, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. Now we count that to be chaſtitie, both to keep pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in a ſingle life, and alſo to have the laws of wedlock obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and we affirme wedlock, as we did before deſcribe it, to be a ſocietie inſtituted, and conſecrated of God, and that this verie ſociety, and the duties of a life in wedlock, do pleaſe God. And we condemne all thoſe fanaticall ſpirits, <hi>Baſilides, Tatianus, Carpocrates,</hi> and ſuch like, whereof ſome by one meanes, and ſome by another, did either condemne wedlock, or did approve filthy confuſions. Alſo we condemne that Popiſh law, which forbiddeth Prieſts to marry, and giveth occaſion of deſtruction to a great multitude of men, and for the ſame cauſe we doe utterly diſlike the Monaſticall vowes of ſingle life. Touching other cauſes wee ſhall ſpeake hereafter: for thoſe Popiſh lawes and vowes are flat contrary to the law of God. The Lord ſaid, <hi>It is not good for man to bee alone: He ſaid,</hi> that is, by his unſpeakable wiſedome he decreed in this ſort to make mankinde, that by the ſocietie of man and woman it might be propagated.

                     <p>Although God hath ſaid and decreed theſe things, yet <hi>Tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> the Pope, and the Monks doe ſay the contrarie: who when as they forbid marriage, doe give occaſion to many men, being otherwiſe fit unto vertue, to heape up many horrible ſinnes, by reaſon whereof very many doe fall headlong into eternall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the wrath of God is more kindled againſt whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. A law of man, being contrarie to the decree of God, and to the very work of God inſtituted and eſtabliſhed in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and alſo to the commandements of God, and that law, which is the fountaine of great wickedneſſe and hainous deeds, for the which both many doe periſh, and the wrath of God is the more kindled, yea which law the holy Ghoſt doth affirme to have it beginning from the Devil, is in no caſe to bee laid upon the Church, but by the conſent of all godly men to be aboliſhed. Now it hath fallen out very often within theſe 30. yeers, that Prieſts, whoſe manners were blameleſſe, and honeſt, have chiefly beene put to death becauſe they were married. Thus the Devil goeth about to eſtabliſh his law by moſt cruell murders, and he hath for his inſtruments, moſt impudent writers, <hi>Ecchius, Faber, Pighius,</hi> who hath expreſſely written, <hi>That a Prieſt doth leſſe offend, if he be an adulterer, then if he marry a wife.</hi> It is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thing that theſe, who will be counted Chriſtians, ſhould write and ſpeake ſuch things. Wiſe men doe ſee that in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining age of the world, both the nature of men is more weak, and by little and little there is greater releaſing and confuſion of diſcipline. And at all times a licenſe in this kind did immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe before the deſtroying of Cities, and the ruines of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Therefore ſuch as are governours ought to be more vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and ſevere in maintaining diſcipline, in ſtrengthning the laws of wedlock, in puniſhing and prohibiting wandring luſts: touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which matter we rejoyce that our admonitions be extant for all poſterity, and we alſo deſire the Sonne of God, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the keeper of his Church, and a true lover of charitie, that he would bow the mindes of Governours to liſten to wholſome counſels, and repreſſe the Devil, which kindled the flames of luſts, and hinder evill examples that they may not be farre ſpread. The mindes and hearts of all godly men doe tremble, when they reade, and heare of ſuch foule and horrible heatheniſh
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:61072:244"/> examples: the which truly afterward were accompanied both with blindneſſe in the mindes, and with other outrages, which were pernicious to whole Nations, as in the hiſtories of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then examples doe every where offer themſelves to all men. The <hi>Scedaſians</hi> had caſt into a well two daughters of <hi>Spartanus</hi> being deflowred: afterward, as it were in the very ſame footſtop, the armie of the Lacedemonians wasſlain, and the Empire changed. But there be many examples of all ages. We our ſelves doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that certain Biſhops, who were famous for their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and their wits, were ſlaine in adulterie. But we beſeech the Sonne of God, that for this cauſe he would preſerve many, and bow them unto chaſtitie, that he may ſincerely be invocated of many. As for thoſe things which are alledged of our odverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the defence of ſingle life, they are as well applied to the matter, as that ſaying of Chriſt to <hi>Solomon,</hi> which <hi>Tacianus</hi> did alledge out of the Goſpel according to the Egyptians. <hi>I came to deſtroy the workes of the woman: Tacianus</hi> did thus interpret it, <hi>I came to deſtroy, that is, to aboliſh wodlocke:</hi>

We ſpeake now of the preſent Monks, which are not in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but are Colledges of men either learned, or unlearned, which doe live more commodiouſly in the open light, and in places of greateſt reſort, then other men doe. They have thoſe pleaſures which they deſire, ſome one, ſome another: and they have much more leaſure, then other men have, that live either in civill, or in domeſticall affaires. Neither doe they now transfer unto themſelves thoſe ridiculous praiſes of perfection, and of a contemplative life, as in times paſt ſome did. And ſeeing that there is great difference in divers ſocieties of men, we will not
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:61072:244"/> preach to the evill, who for the kitchins, and all licentiouſneſſe, do love thoſe darke places: but thoſe, of whom there is hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, we do earneſtly requeſt, for the glory of God and their owne ſalvation, that they would think upon theſe ſayings: <hi>Thou ſhalt have no ſtrange Gods. Flie from Idols.</hi> What manner of thing is the Monaſticall life now adayes? It hath very much wicked worſhip, and vanitie: their Maſſes for the quick and the dead they ſet out to ſale, and this is the greateſt gaine that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries for the moſt part have: there is uſed invocation of the dead, heaped up with very foule ſuperſtitions: as with the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Images, with indulgences, and other jugling tricks.

Theſe onely cauſes are great enough, why men, which are not prophane, ought to depart out of ſuch ſocieties: becauſe that the vowes, which wrap them in a kinde of life, wherein is the worſhip of Idols, are without doubt fruſtrate, according to the firſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which is immoveable, eternall, and the rule of all other commandements. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no ſtrange Gods, Exod.</hi> 20.

Concerning widows, <hi>They have loſt their firſt faith:</hi> But the anſwer is ſure and cleare, although <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſpeak of vows, yet would he in no caſe alow of ſuch vows, as are joyned with the worſhip of Idols, and with many errors. But there be alſo many other lies in vows. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe chaſtitie and poverty: but how many of them be fit to leade a ſingle life, they themſelves do know. And touching poverty, they know that the farre greater part doth there rather ſeeke kitchins well furniſhed, then for poverty and hunger.</p>
                     <p>Now we muſt alſo conſider of this: let eloquent men excuſe and praiſe the Monaſticall life as they liſt, yet alwaies this opinion is confirmed in men, that are not prophane, by this example, that ſuch works, choſen by mans deviſe, are the worſhip of God: that is, ſuch works whereby God doth count himſelfe to be honoured. This opinion is to be reproved and to be pulled out of the minds of men, and men are to be drawn back to the commandements of God, according to this ſaying, <hi>Mat. 15. In vain do they worſhip me with the commandements of men.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Walke not after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of your fathers, but walke ye in my commandements.</hi> This is a true and notable reprehenſion of the Monaſticall life. Now if they doe faine hereunto merits and perfections, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt touching the righteouſneſſe of faith and true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:61072:245"/> is the more obſcured: becauſe it is a foule and horrible lie, that monaſticall obſervations ſhould merit remiſſion of ſinnes, or be of ſo great value, as is Baptiſme, as <hi>Thomas</hi> doth expreſſely ſay: Neither was antiquitie ignorant of this reprehenſion. There is a narration extant, whether it be true, or written onely for doctrines ſake, yet doth it ſhew forth the judgements of godly men: <hi>They write, that when Antonie, deſired to know, how much he had profited before God in thoſe externall exerciſes, there was ſhewed unto him a Coblers houſe at Alexandria, being next doore to him. He therefore going in ſpeaketh to the good man of the houſe, queſtioneth with him concerning doctrine, and exerciſes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The Cobler anſwereth ſincerely touching doctrine.

And uſeſt thou no other ſtreighter exerciſe, ſaith Antonie? why, ſaith he, doth he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour alittle, trow you, that provideth how his family ſhall be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? and many things doe oftentimes happen, which doe ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Neither is it now needfull to adde a longer diſcourſe, eſpecially ſeeing that no man is ignorant, how that in thoſe places, where Monks be, there is much wicked ſuperſtition in Monaſteries, and that the ſtudies of doctrine are either none at all, or very corrupt.

                     <p>VVE confeſſe that Wedlock is a kind of life, inſtituted and approved of God, and that <hi>it is</hi>

                        <hi>a myſtery,</hi> that is, as commonly it uſeth to be expounded, a great Sacrament, <hi>in Chriſt and his Church,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. And becauſe Chriſt doth evidently affirme, that wedlock doth pertaine to this preſent life and the adminiſtration of the things of this life doe conſiſt of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique laws being made upon right and probable reaſon, therefore we teach that it is lawfull to marry in theſe degrees of conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and affinity which <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2. obſervation.</note> the politique lawes, which are the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, do permit. Alſo we teach, that thoſe which be young ought not to marry without the authority of their parents, and that the marriage which is contracted by a raſh and unlawfull conſent of young parties without the authority of them, in whoſe power they are, is not to be counted as ratified: For although there be certain caſes, wherein it is lawfull to marry without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of parents, yet it ſeemeth not good to make a generall rule thereof, as though every conſent of young parties, ſhould ratifie the contract of marriage, and as though privie marriages were to be approved. For not onely the commandement of God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that children ſhould honour their Parents, but alſo naturall reaſon doth command, that the conſent of parents ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted in making a marriage: hitherto alſo are children called by the politique lawes. And there is a decree of Pope <hi>Euaraſtus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, the words whereof be theſe: <hi>Marriage as we have heard of our fathers and have found it delivered unto us of the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours, is not otherwiſe made lawfull, but when a wiſe is ſought for at their hands, and affianced by the neereſt Parents, who ſeeme to have authoritie over the maid or woman, and in whoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie ſhe is.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover we doe not doubt, but that they which are in deed lovers of honeſty, do think that it is not free for the lay men onely, as they call them, but alſo for the Miniſters of the Church, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For the Epiſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Marriage is honourable in all men, and the bed that is undefiled.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> alloweth of marriage in a Biſhop, &amp; affirmeth that <hi>the forbidding of marriage is a ſpirit of errours, and a doctrine of devils.</hi> For though this ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="452" facs="tcp:61072:246"/> is commonly expounded of the Tatians and Eucratians, who thought that marriage doth nothing at all differ from whordome, yet notwithſtanding ſeeing that marriage is forbidden in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh decrees, it is forbidden by the ſame reaſons, by the which marriage is wholly condemned, and not in one kinde of men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For that ſaying is alledged out of <hi>Leviticus, Be ye holy, becauſe I am holy:</hi> and that of <hi>Paul, Not in chambering and wantonneſſe:</hi> And againe, <hi>They which are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God.</hi> But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe ſayings of the Scripture do pertaine to all men, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they might drive all godly men from marriage, if they were fitly applied to forbid marriage unto Prieſts. But we hope that all good men do think more honeſtly of marriage, and that they do not diſlike of that in the Miniſters thereof, which they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in the Church it ſelfe, eſpecially ſeeing that there be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt examples of the Church, when as yet it was but freſh and more pure, wherein it was lawfull, both for the Apoſtles which was the higheſt degree in the Church, and alſo for Biſhops, to have their wives. And we think that this thing is ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that it was not only lawfull for the miniſters of the Church to be married, before they were ordained miniſters, but alſo to marry after their ordination. For which opinion there be very evident arguments.</p>
                     <p>Neither ought the vow of chaſtitie to be any hinderance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, becauſe that ſuch a vow being taken upon a man by humane ſuperſtition, without the authoritie of the word of God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt faith, is not acknowledged of God, and wedlock alſo hath it chaſtity, that he which before had vowed chaſtitie, &amp; marrieth a wife in the Lord, doth indeed fulfill the vow of chaſtitie. Seeing therefore that the word of God is evident, touching the hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of wedlock, the examples of the Apoſtles and Biſhops of the Primitive Church be evident, the weakneſſe of mans nature is evident, dangers of ſingle life be evident, and ſeeing that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, which unchaſte Prieſts do give, are evident, we do verily hope that it will come to paſſe, that they which have the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, will not go forward ſeverely to maintaine and defend this conſtitution touching the marriage of Prieſts, but favourably to interpret it. For ſo it ſhall come to paſſe, that there may be both fewer and leſſe offences in the Church, and that many good mens conſciences may be relieved. Alſo we hope that it will come to paſſe, that all good Biſhops and Princes will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:61072:246"/> them, who, by a lawfull divorce, are ſeparated from their adulterous wives or husbands, to uſe that libertie of marrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the Lord, which the Sonne of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath granted to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and 16.</p>

                     <p>THere is no doubt but that godly, juſt, and lawfull vowes are to be kept and payed, and that wicked vowes are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulled. But it is not without cauſe made a matter of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, in what kinde of vowes Monaſticall vowes touching virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or ſingle life, povertie and obedience, are to be placed. For it is evident, that ſingle life, is not commanded by the Word of God: alſo it is evident, that although the eſtate of ſingle perſons be in publike dangers quiet, and more fit and commodious to execute the publike Miniſteries of the Church, then is theirs, which uſe it not, yet we muſt not think, that this kind of life is of it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunal ſeat of God more excellent, and more holy, then is marriage. For as in <hi>Chriſt there is neither Iew, nor Grecian, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervant nor freeman,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, ſo in Chriſt, there is neither married, nor unmarried. And as, <hi>In Chriſt Ieſus circumciſion avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nothing, but the keeping of the commandements of God, and a new creature:</hi> ſo alſo doth ſingle life availe nothing, and wedlock availeth nothing, but to be renued in Chriſt Ieſus, and to obey the calling of Chriſt. In the Councel held at <hi>Gangrum</hi> there was this Canon: <hi>If any of thoſe, who for the Lords ſake do keep virginitie, is lifted up againſt thoſe that be married, let him be accurſed.</hi> And an other Canon ſaith, <hi>If any man, for continencie, as it is thought, doth weare a cloake, as beleeving that hereby he hath righteouſneſſe, and doth deſpiſe others, who with reverence doe weare other common and uſuall kindes of garments, let him be accurſed.</hi> And <hi>Auguſtine, De bono coniugali, cap, 21. dareth not preferre the virginitie of the Baptiſt, before the wedlock of Abraham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore he that doth vow virginitie or ſingle life, doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vow it, as a ſingular worſhip of God (And then becauſe the ſtate of ſingle life is not commanded by the word of God, this vow pertaineth to the commandements of men, whereof Chriſt ſaith, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the precepts of men.</hi>) Or elſe he worketh it, as a merit of remiſſion of ſinnes, and of life eternall, and then it is evidently a wicked vow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:61072:247"/> no man is bound. It is to no better purpoſe to vow pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For either thou are poore by condition or eſtate, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt no earthly ſubſtance: (And then this croſſe, which God hath laid upon thee, thou muſt beare it patiently, which moreover if thou doe vow, thou doeſt nothing elſe, then if in thy ſickneſſe thou ſhouldeſt vow, that thou wouldeſt alwaies bee ſicke, or that in thy infamie, thou ſhouldeſt alwaies vow to be infamous: which kind of vow is rather a madneſſe, then godlineſſe.) Or elſe thou doſt poſſeſſe ſubſtance, and voweſt that, forſaking thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, thou wilt alwaies leade a poore life, and get thy living by beging, and obtaine, by the merit of this vow, eternall life: and then this vow is firſt of al repugnant to the love of thy neighbour, which requireth, that by thy begging thou be not troubleſome to any, further then neceſſitie compelleth: ſecondly it is contrary to faith in Chriſt, becauſe that he alone is the merit of eternall life. Therefore it is evident, that this kind of vow is unlawful and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. But ſo to forſake thy ſubſtance, as to give it to a common uſe, is not to follow after poverty, but to provide a more certaine and bountiful living for thy ſelfe: the which what manner of worſhip it is before God, it cannot be unknown. And as for obedience, it is either referred to God, and then it is not an arbitrary vow, but of due neceſſitie, of which obedience it is ſaid, <hi>Obedience is better then ſacrifice:</hi> Or elſe it is referred to man, and then of their owne accord they are to perform thoſe duties, which the ſubject oweth to the Magiſtrate, children to the Parents, ſervants to their Lords, and ſchollers to their Schoolemaſters. Theſe things doth God look for at mens hands whether they be vowed, or not vowed: but yet with this condition, <hi>that we do alwaies rather obey God, then men.</hi> But to vow obedience unto man, without a ſpeciall calling of God, that by the works of ſuch obedience, a man may not onely performe a ſingular worſhip unto God, but alſo purge his ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, it is altogether ſuperfluous (becauſe that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>They worſhip me in vain with the traditions of men</hi>) and alſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, becauſe the obedience of Chriſt alone, which he performed to God his Father, hath puged our ſinnes, and reconciled us with God. By all theſe things it is manifeſt, that the kinde of vowing ſingle life, povertie, and obedience, doth not agree with that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is indeed Catholique, eſpecially ſeeing that certain men are not afraid, to make this kinde of vowing equall with Baptiſme.</p>

For we ſaw that this liberty of Chriſtians was vehemently challenged in every place by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whereby every Chriſtian man doth aſſure himſelfe, that all righteouſneſſe and ſalvation is to be ſought for onely in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, and is alſo aſſured, that he muſt at all times uſe all the things of this life, as to the profit of our neighbours, ſo to the glory of God: and that all which he hath is to be arbitrated, and moderated by the holy Ghoſt, who is the giver of true adoption and true libertie, and that he ought freely to permit them to be appointed, and beſtowed both to the reliefe of his neighbours, and alſo to the advancement of the glory of God. Seeing that we retaine this libertie, we ſhew our ſelves to be the ſervants of Chriſt: when we betray it to men, addicting our ſelves to their inventions, we doe like runnagates, forſake Chriſt, and flie to men. The which thing we doe ſo much the more wickedly, becauſe that Chriſt hath freed us by his blood not by a vile or common price, and hath redeemed us to himſelfe from the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlavery of Satan. And this is the cauſe, why Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> did ſo much deteſt it, that they had addicted themſelves to the ceremonies of the law, though they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, whereas notwithſtanding, as we declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that might be farre better excuſed, then to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the yoke of thoſe ceremonies, which men have feigned of their own brain. For he did write, and that truely, that they which admit the yoke, of thoſe ceremonies, <hi>deſpiſe the grace of God, and count the death of Chriſt as a thing of nothing:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſaith, <hi>That he is afraid, leſt that he had beſtowed his labour among them in vain:</hi> and he exhorteth them, <hi>That they would ſtand ſtedfaſt in that liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and not to be intangled againe, with the yoke of bondage.</hi>

                  <p>Now it is evident, that Monkerie is nothing elſe then bondage of traditions deviſed by men, and indeed of ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> hath by name condemned in the places which we alledged. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:61072:248"/> they which profeſſe Monkerie doe addict themſelves to thoſe inventions of men for hope of merits. And hereupon it is, that they make it ſo hainous an offence, to forſake thoſe inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to imbrace the libertie of Chriſt. Therefore, ſeeing<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.</note> that <hi>as well our body, as our ſpirit, belong unto God,</hi> and that in a double reſpect, to wit, of our condition, and Redemption, it can not be lawfull for Chriſtians, to make themſelves ſlaves to this Monaſticall ſervitude, much leſſe then for prophane ſervants, to change their maſters. Moreover it cannot be denied, but that by ſuch like bondage and vowes, to live after the commandement of men, a certaine neceſſitie (as it alwaies uſeth to be) of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the law of God is brought in. For the law of God doth require, that a Chriſtian man ſhould, as much as lyeth in him,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> imploy his ſervice to the benefit of the Magiſtrate, his parents, kinred, and others; and of all thoſe, whom the Lord hath made his neighbours, and brought to him to be delivered, in what place, time, or manner ſoever their neceſſitie ſhall require it. Then let him imbrace that kinde of living, whereby he may chiefely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the affaires of his neighbours, neither let him chuſe a ſingle life, but let him know that to renounce marriage, and to make himſelfe an Eunuch for the kingdome of heaven, that is, to further godlineſſe, and the glory of God, it is a peculiar and a ſpeciall gift of God. For that Edict which <hi>Paul</hi> did publiſh, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth firme and ſtedfaſt, neither can any vowes of men make it fruſtrate; <hi>For the avoyding of whoredome let every man</hi> (he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth none) <hi>have his owne wife, and every woman her owne huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. For all men doe not receive that word, of taking upon them a ſingle life for the kingdome of heaven,</hi> as Chriſt himſelfe doth witneſſe, then whom no man did more certainly know, &amp; more faithfully teach, either of what force mans nature is, or what is acceptable to his Father. Now it is certaine, that by theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall vowes, they which doe make them are bound to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of men, ſo that they thinke it not lawfull to ſhew themſelves obedient and dutifull any longer, either to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, or to their parents, or to any men (onely the chiefe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Monaſterie excepted) nor to releeve them with their ſubſtance, and leaſt of all to marry a wife, though they be greatly burned, and therefore they doe neceſſarily fall into all kindes of diſhoneſties of life.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that it is evident, that theſe Monaſticall
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:61072:248"/> vows doe make a man, which is freed from the ſervice of Chriſt, to be in danger, not ſo much of the bondage of men, as of Sathan, and that they do bring in a certaine neceſſitie of tranſgreſſing the law of God, (according to the nature of all ſuch traditions as are deviſed by men) and that therefore they be manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the commandements of God, we doe, not without cauſe, beleeve, that they are to be made fruſtrate, ſeeing that not onely the written law, but alſo the law of nature doth command to diſanull a promiſe, if being kept, it be a hinderance to good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not onely to religion. Therefore we could not withſtand any which would change a Monaſticall life, which is undoubtedly a bondage to Sathan, for a Chriſtian life, as alſo we could not withſtand others of the Eccleſiaſticall order, who marrying wives, have imbraced a kinde of life, whereof their neighbours might looke for more profit, and greater honeſtie of life, then of that kinde wherein they lived before. To conclude, neither did we take upon us to drive them from the right of wedlocke, who among us have perſevered in the miniſtery of the word of God, whatſoever chaſtitie they had vowed, for the cauſes before ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſeeing that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the chiefe maintainer of true chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, doth admit even a Biſhop to be a married man. For we have lawfully preferred this one law of God before all laws of men, <hi>For the avoiding of whoredome, let every man have his owne wife.</hi> Which law truly, for that it hath been rejected ſo long time, all kindes of luſt, even thoſe which are not to be named (be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with reverence to your ſacred Majeſtie O noble <hi>Ceſar</hi>) have more then horribly overthrowne this Eccleſiaſticall order, ſo that at this day amongſt men there be none more abhominable then they, which beare the name of Prieſts.</p>

His chiefeſt dutie is, to procure and maintaine peace and publique tranquillitie. Which doubtleſſe he ſhall never doe more happily, then when he ſhall be truly ſeaſoned with the feare of God and true religion, namely, when he ſhall after the example of moſt holy Kings and Princes of the people of the Lord, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the preaching of the truth, and the pure and ſincere faith, and ſhall root out lies, and all ſuperſtition, with all impietie and Idolatry, and ſhall defend the Church of God. For indeed we teach that the care of religion doth chiefly appertaine to the holy Magiſtrate: let him therefore hold the word of God in his hands, and look that nothing be taught contrary thereunto. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner let him governe the people committed to him of God <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſervation. upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> with good laws, made according to the word of God. Let him hold them in diſcipline, and in their dutie, and in obedience, let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crciſe judgement by judging uprightly, let him not accept any mans perſon, or receive bribes: let him deliver widdows, father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe children, and thoſe that be afflicted from wrong: let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:61072:249"/> yea and cut off ſuch as are unjuſt either by deceit, or by violence. For he hath not received the ſword of God in vaine. Therefore let him draw forth this ſword of God againſt all male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> ſeditious perſons, theeves, or murderers, oppreſſours; blaſphemers, perjured perſons, and all thoſe whom God hath commanded him to puniſh or execute. Let him ſuppreſſe ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born heretiques (which are heretiques in deed) who ceaſe not to blaſpheme the majeſtie of God, and to trouble the Church, yea and finally to deſtroy it: but if ſo be it be neceſſary to preſerve the ſafetie of the people by warre, let him doe it in the name of God, ſo that he firſt ſeeke peace by all means poſſible, and uſe it not ſave onely then, when he can ſave his ſubjects no way but by warre. And while as the Magiſtrate doth theſe things in faith, he ſerveth God by thoſe works, as with ſuch as be good works, and ſhall receive a bleſſing from the Lord.</p>
                     <p>We condemne the Anabaptiſts, who as they denie that a Chriſtian man ſhould beare the office of a Magiſtrate, ſo alſo they deny that any man can juſtly be put to death by the Magiſtrate, or that the Magiſtrate may make warre, or that oathes ſhould be performed to the Magiſtrates, and ſuch like things. For as God will worke the ſafetie of his people by the Magiſtrate, whom he hath given to be as it were a father of the world, ſo all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are commanded to acknowledge this benefit of God in the Magiſtrate: therefore let them honour and reverence the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, as the miniſter of God, let them love him, favour him, and pray for him, as their father, and let them obey all his juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall commandements: Finally, let them pay all cuſtomes and tributes and all other duties of the like ſort, faithfully and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">* Looke the 2.

For he that oppoſeth himſelfe againſt the Magiſtrate, doth procure the wrath of God againſt him. We condemne therefore all contemners of Magiſtrates, as rebels, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Common-wealth, ſeditious villaines, and in a word, all ſuch as doe either openly or cloſely refuſe to performe thoſe duties which they ought to doe, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>ANd hitherto have been informed and ſhewed unto your Majeſtie in this writing the reaſons and cauſes of our faith and doctrine and Chriſtian religion: ſuch doctrine as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of our Churches, all and ſingular, every one according to the gift of God granted unto him, doe with one conſent of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hold, talke of, and preach, and doe conſtantly maintaine and fight for the ſame, not with the power of this world, but by holy Scriptures, againſt thoſe that impugne it, or by teaching do ſpread abroad contrary errours thereunto. Neither yet without that modeſtie that becometh the profeſſion of Chriſtians, doe they ſtubbornly rather then rigorouſly perſiſt in this doctrine, or have at any time heretofore perſiſted: but if any thing be found herein not well taken by them, and that by certaine grounds out of the word of God (which ought to be the rule of judgement unto all men) peaceably, and with a meeke ſpirit (as it ought to be done) be ſhewed unto them, they are ready and forward, and thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as alwayes heretofore, ſo now they offer themſelves, that after
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:61072:252"/> due conſideration and true knowledge of the truth had, they will moſt gladly, and thankfully receive that doctrine which ſhall have better foundations, and willingly reforme whatſoever ſhall have need to be amended. Wherefore moſt excellent King, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord, may it pleaſe your Majeſtie to examine this our confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and after diligent and due conſideration had, to way and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether any man worthily and for juſt cauſe, may reject, and condemne this doctrine, as not agreeable to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor Chriſtian. Verily, we are of opinion, that if any man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to deſpiſe, or condemne this doctrine, he muſt of neceſſitie alſo condemne the holy Scripture, from whence it was taken, and the ancient, and true Chriſtian Doctors, with whom it agreeth, and alſo the holy Church it ſelfe, which from the beginning, and that conſtantly, ſo hath, and doth teach. And hereby your Majeſtie may graciouſly perceive and determine, whether the complaints and accuſations of our Adverſaries, and ſuch as favour not us and our Teachers, be juſt or no. Wherefore moſt humbly we pray, that your ſacred Majeſtie will give no place or credit to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, in thoſe matters which divers wayes without any ground they charge us withall, when as without all humanitie they accuſe us, our Miniſters and Preachers, as if we had another religion, and taught another doctrine, then that which at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we offer unto your Majeſtie; or that we preſume ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take in hand, or do attempt any other thing againſt God, and your Majeſtie, and contrary to the inſtitutions of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and to the publique law of the kingdome of Bohemia. And your Majeſtie may well call to your remembrance that we have every way, and at all times, behaved our ſelves obediently and peaceably, and in all things which may turne or belong to the preſervation of your Majeſties perſon, and to the publique good, and commoditie of the whole Realme: in all ſuch things, I ſay, we have indeauoured not to be behinde others: and hereafter alſo we offer our ſelves moſt ready to performe the ſame, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our allegiance and dutie. Neither doe we thinke it onely a point of vertue, and to appertaine unto honeſty alone and the good eſtate of the Common-wealth, to yeeld our ſelves ſubject and faithfull to your Majeſtie, for peace, concord and the rewards of this life, but much rather we acknowledge that it pleaſeth God, and that ſo is his will, that every one for conſcience ſake ſhould be obedient to the Magiſtrate, and ſhould reverence, love,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:61072:253"/> honour, and highly eſteeme him: even as our Teachers alſo doe deale both with us, and with the people to performe this, and oftentimes by teaching out of the word doe inforce it upon us both.</p>
                     <p>Here we commend our ſelves unto your Majeſtie, as to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and liberall tuition, care and protection of our moſt gracious Lord, and doe moſt humbly beſeech of your Majeſtie, that unto theſe things, which on the behalfe of Chriſtian religion we have tendred unto your Majeſtie, we may receive a courteous anſwer, and ſuch as God may be pleaſed withall. The Almightie and everlaſting God graciouſly preſerve your Majeſtie in continuall health, to the profit, benefit, and increaſe of his holy Chriſtian Church. <hi>Amen.</hi>

There have been great complaints of Indulgences and Pilgrimages, and of the abuſe of excommunication, Pariſhes have been divers wayes moleſted by Catchpoles: there have been many brawles and bickerings betweene Pariſh Prieſts and Monks about this, who had greater right to the Pariſh, and about commiſſions, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and extraordinary Sermons, and other ſuch innumerable things, ſuch like matters we have permitted, that ſuch as are the principal in this cauſe, being ſhortly ſet down, might the better be underſtood.

Onely we have rehearſed ſuch things, as ſeemed neceſſary to be ſpoken, to the end that it might be ſeene, that nothing is received among us in doctrine or ceremonies,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:61072:255"/> contrary to the Scripture, or the Catholike Church.

                     <p>BY the benefit of God this part alſo of doctrine of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Magiſtrate, that beareth the ſword, and of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Laws and Iudgements, and of the whole civill ſtate is godlily ſet forth: and by great travell, and many writings the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold and great furies of the Anabaptiſts and other fantaſticall men are refuted. We teach therefore that in the whole doctrine of God delivered by the Apoſtles and Prophets, and degrees of the civill ſtate are avouched, and that Magiſtrates, Laws, order in judgements and the lawfull ſocietie of mankinde, are not by chance ſprung up among men. And although there be many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible confuſions, which grow from the Devill, and the madneſſe of men, yet the lawfull government and ſocietie of men is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, and whatſoever order is yet left by the exceeding goodneſſe of God, it is preſerved for the Church ſake, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and <hi>Pſal. 126. Except the Lord keepe the Citie, in vaine he watcheth, that keepeth it, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore in themſelves they are things good, to beare the authoritie of a Magiſtrate, to be a Iudge, to be a Miniſter, to execute judgements, to make lawfull warres, and to be a ſouldier in lawfull warres, &amp;c. And a Chriſtian man may uſe theſe things, as he uſeth meat, drinke, medicines, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling. Neither doth he ſinne that is a Magiſtrate, and diſchargeth his vocation, that exerciſeth judgement, that goeth to warre, that puniſheth lawfully thoſe that are condemned, &amp;c. And <hi>ſubiects owe unto the civill Magiſtrate obedience,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Romanes 13. Not onely becauſe of wrath,</hi> that is, for feare of corporall puniſhment, wherewith the rebellious are rewarded by the Magiſtrate, <hi>but alſo for conſcience ſake,</hi> that is, rebellion is a ſinne that offendeth God, and withdraweth the conſcience from God.</p>
                     <p>This heavenly doctrin we propound unto the Churches which eſtabliſheth lawfull authoritie, and the whole civill ſtate, and we ſhew the difference of the Goſpell, and the civill government. God would have all men to be ruled and kept in order by civill government, even thoſe that are not regenerate, &amp; in this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:61072:256"/> the wiſdome, juſtice, and goodneſſe of God toward man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, is moſt clearely to be ſeene. His wiſdome is declared by order, which is in the diſcerning of vertues and vices, and in the ſocietie of mankinde under lawfull government, and in contracts guided and diſpoſed by marvellous wiſdome. Then the juſtice of God appeareth in civill government, in that he will have open ſinnes to be puniſhed by the Magiſtrates, and when they that are in authoritie doe not take puniſhment on offenders, God himſelfe miraculouſly draweth them unto puniſhment, and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doth lay upon grievous ſins, grievous puniſhment in this life: as it is ſaid, <hi>Matth. 26. Whoſoever taketh the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword,</hi> and <hi>Heb. 3. Whoremongers and adulterers, God will iudge.</hi> In theſe puniſhments God will have to be ſeene the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of vertues and vices, and will have us learne that God is wiſe, juſt, true, and chaſte. The goodneſſe of God alſo toward mankinde is ſeene, in that he preſerveth the ſocietie of men after this order. And for that cauſe doth he maintaine it, that from thence his Church may be gathered, and he will have Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes to be places for the entertainment of his Church. And the civill government is one thing, which keepeth in order all men, even thoſe that are not regenerate: and forgiveneſſe of ſins, and righteouſneſſe in the heart, which is the beginning of life and of eternall ſalvation, which by the voice of the Goſpell is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the hearts of them that beleeve, is another thing. Both theſe benefits God hath beſtowed upon mankinde, and will have us to underſtand the difference of civill juſtice, and light in our hearts. Neither doth the Goſpell condemne or overthrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths or families. And although it belong not to thoſe that teach in the Church, to give particular laws of politique go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, yet the word of God doth generally teach this of the power of the Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God would that the Magiſtrate without all doubt ſhould ſound forth the voice of the morall law among men, touching diſcipline, according to the ten commandements or the law na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; that is, he would have by the voice of the Magiſtrate, firſt ſoveraigne and immutable laws to be propounded, forbidding the worſhip of Idols, blaſphemies, perjuries, unjuſt murders, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring luſts, breach of of wedlock, theft, and fraud in bargains, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and judgements.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond dutie. Let the Magiſtrate be an obſerver of theſe
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:61072:256"/> divine and immutable lawes, which are witneſſes of God, and chiefe rules of manners, by puniſhing all thoſe that tranſgreſſe the ſame, For the voyce of the law without puniſhment and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is little availeable to bridle and reſtraine men. Therefore it is ſaid by Saint <hi>Paul, Rom. 13. The Magiſtrate is a terrour to him that doth evill, and giveth honour to them that doe well.</hi> And well hath it beene ſaid of old, <hi>The Magiſtrate is a keeper of the Law,</hi> that is, of the firſt and ſecond Table, as concerning diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and good order.</p>
                     <p>The third dutie of the civill Magiſtrate is to adde unto the law naturall, ſome other lawes, defining the circumſtances of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall law, and to keep and maintaine the ſame by puniſhing the tranſgreſſours: but at no hand to ſuffer or defend lawes contrary to the law of God or nature, as it is written, <hi>Iſa. 10. Woe be to them that make wicked lawes.</hi> For kingdomes are the ordinance of God, wherein the wiſedome and juſtice of God, that is, juſt lawes ought to rule, even as the wiſe King, and one that feared God, <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron. 19. Ye exerciſe not the iudgement of men, but of God, who is with you in iudgement. Let the feare of God be with you, and doe all things diligently.</hi> For although many in kingdomes doe deſpiſe the glory of God, yet notwithſtanding this ought to be their eſpeciall care, to heare and imbrace the true doctrine of the Sonne of God, and to cheriſh the Churches, as the ſecond <hi>Pſalme</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>And now ye Kings underſtand, and be learned ye that iudge the earth.</hi> And <hi>Pſal. 23.

And <hi>Iſa. 49. and Kings and Queenes ſhall be thy nurces,</hi> that is, let common wealths be nurces of the Church, let them give entertainement to the Church, and to godly ſtudies. Let Kings and Princes themſelves be members of the Church, and rightly underſtand the doctrine thereof, and give no help unto thoſe that eſtabliſh falſe doctrine, and exerciſe unjuſt crueltie, and remember this ſaying. <hi>I will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them that honour me.</hi> And <hi>Daniel</hi> in the fourth Chapter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the King of Babylon, to acknowledge the wrath of God, and to ſhew mercy to the baniſhed Church, when he ſaith, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thy ſinnes with righteouſneſſe and with mercy towards the poore, and there ſhall be a healing of thy tranſgreſsions.</hi> And ſince they are among the principall members of the Church, let them provide that judgement be rightly exerciſed in the Church, as

                        <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Arcadius, Martian, Charles</hi> the great, and many godly Kings have provided, that judgement in the Church ſhould be ſincerely executed. But of the difference of both ſtates, namely of the Miniſterie of the Goſpel, and the civill Magiſtracie, there are many writings in our Church, which declare, that we teach no phantaſticall nor ſeditious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, but doe ſhew the neceſſary doctrine delivered in the Goſpel touching both degrees, profitable to godlineſſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peace.</p>

                     <p>THis is the ſumme of that doctrine, which by the bleſſing of God with one conſent we teach in our Churches, which to be the ſincere meaning of the doctrine delivered from God in the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and in the Creeds, we nothing doubt, and it may be underſtood out of the ancient and purer writers, to bee agreeable to the ancient and purer Churches. Now the matter it ſelfe declareth, that we have not ſought to diſpute about new fangled, curious and ſubtle queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, neither doe ſtrive about authoritie or riches, but onely to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and bring to light from the great darkneſſe of traditions and opinions, that doctrine which is neceſſary to the true invocation of God, to true worſhip, to the right knowledge of the Sonne of God, and to the ſalvation of ſoules, and doe in moſt ſimple and plaine manner propound the ſame unto the Churches. For all wiſe men muſt needs confeſſe that there was much obſcuritie and many errours in the doctrine of the Monkes, and many ſnares of conſcience in the Popes traditions: and whether doctrine is true, plaine, evident, profitable for conſciences, and for manners, compariſon doth declare. For we avoid not the judgements of the godly, yea rather we deſire that the whole true Church of God, that is, all the faithfull and learned, whereſoever they are, may underſtand what we ſay, who we doubt not will be witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that this doctrine is the conſent of the true Catholike Church of God. Alſo we offer our ſelves at any time, to a more full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in every point; and think that this rehearſall of our doctrine now made is agreeable to the confeſſion exhibited at <hi>Auſpurge, Anno,</hi> 1530.</p>
                     <p>For as much therefore as the doctrine, which we here recite,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:61072:257"/> is true, and neceſſary for the Church, we intreat that our Churches may not be condemned, as if they either imbraced errours, or fooliſhly or ſeditiouſly ſtirred up ſtrife without any weightie cauſe. The truth, and weight of the matters may deliver us from this unjuſt accuſation. Next after a godly manner, we admoniſh the Councel it ſelfe. They ſee that old abuſes and many great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are as yet ſticking in the Church, becauſe in all ages even from the beginning of mankinde the devill continueth ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſeed of errour, and ſince that time through the ignorance of men, by ſuperſtition they are either confirmed, or doe ſhoote forth againe. And now for that the vanitie of many ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is knowne, the times require a reformation, and unleſſe the Governours provide that the truth may be brought to light, great diviſion in opinions is like to follow: eſpecially becauſe in this laſt age of the world great confuſion is to be feared. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the Councel ſee to it, that they condemne not a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt truth. And if a godly ſort they will deliberate how they may provide for the Churches, and if a more ample declaration ſhall be demanded of us, men learned, of underſtanding, loving the truth and fearing God muſt be choſen, to conſult together of theſe ſo weighty matters. Neither let them onely ſtrive with us in number of vices, ſeeing it is manifeſt by many prejudices, of what opinion the Biſhop of Rome, &amp; others that are, are addicted unto him, who now by the ſpace of many yeeres have not onely ſet forth againſt us Edicts written with blood, but alſo have ſlain many of our ſide: and there be many that neither underſtand, nor looke after any truth of doctrine, but being already corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with prophane perſwaſions, doe thinke this to be an eſpeciall part of politique men, to defend the preſent ſtate and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their owne authoritie. And for this purpoſe they ſeeke fit Miniſters, by ſophiſticall juggling to jeſt out the truth Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now we teſtifie that we will not reject the truth, although it be condemned by the judgements of ſuch men. And we openly profeſſe, that we conſent not to the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> which heretofore hath ſent abroad Decrees partly falſe, partly captious and ſophiſticall: but doe earneſtly requeſt that both we may be heard in the ſame matter, and that the errors before confirmed by the Decrees of the Tridentine Councel may be reformed.

                  <head>Out of the Confeſſion of <hi>WIRTEMBERGE.</hi> The Concluſion, which is placed in the latter end of the 35. Chapter.</head>
                  <p>VVE have rehearſed thoſe things, which ſeeme good both to be approved, and alſo to be refuted, or amended in the Eccleſiaſticall doctrine, and in the whole adminiſtration of the Church. And if any thing be ſpoken either more briefly, or more obſcurely, then ſo great a matter would require, our Preachers doe promiſe that they wil expound them more largely, and more cleerely. That which remaineth, we beſeech all the godly through Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, our onely Saviour, that (which thing we hope they will doe of their owne accord) every one according to his office and calling, would take unto himſelfe a true and earneſt endeavour to reforme the Church. It cannot be denied, but that hitherto for theſe many yeeres not onely the diſcipline of the Church hath decayed, and the manners thereof have beene corrupted with great and horrible vices, and they have very much degenerated from the honeſtie of our Elders, but that alſo the doctrine of the Church hath beene depraved in ſuffering and bearing with corruptions: which if hereafter they be either diſſembled, or confirmed, every man that is but meanly wiſe may conſider, how great evils are like to follow in the Church of God. Thoſe execrations and curſings are well known, whereunto the law of God doth addict the tranſgreſſours of his word. And <hi>Joſias</hi> the King of Iuda, was endued with an heroicall minde, when he repaired the Church, and although the wrath of God was by his godly repentance and obedience mittigated (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the book of the law was found out, and well knowne) that thoſe puniſhments, which the Church of God at that time had deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rved, through the neglect of his word and their impietr, might be deferred till another time, yet notwithſtanding ſuch was the ſeveritie of God againſt the contemnets of his word, and the impenitent, that the King although he were very godly, could not altogether take it away from them, and appeaſe it. Now we think that in theſe times the wrath of God is no leſſe, yea much more grievouſly kindled, and ſet on fire againſt the aſſembly of his Church, (by reaſon of ſo many hainous wicked deeds and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:61072:259"/> which even in that people which glorieth in the Name of God, are more evident, then that they can be denied, and more cleere, then that they may be excuſed) then in times paſt, when as yet the Sonne of God was not made knowne to the world by his Goſpel: And the judgement of God ſhall be ſo much the more ſevere, by how much his benefits are the greater, which he ſeemeth to have beſtowed, both in the former, and alſo at theſe preſent times upon unthankfull men.</p>
                  <p>But many other things have need of amendment in the Church and miniſtery thereof, and eſpecially the doctrine of Repentance, Iuſtification, and the uſe of the Sacraments, and ſingle life of the Miniſters of the Church, doe require a godly amendment. If theſe things by the mercy of God, and by the diligence and care of all good men ſhall be reſtored, according to the writings of the Prophets and the Apoſtles, and according to the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique conſent of the ancient and purer Church, we ſhall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give unto God the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt a moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable worſhip, but alſo the whole Chriſtian world ſhall be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to declare their thankfulneſſe and obedience in all dutifull manner that they may. We truly doe not know of any errour in our Preachers, either in doctrine, or in the other adminiſtration of the Church: yet we doe not doubt, but that they are indued with ſo great modeſtie and godlineſſe, that if they be admoniſhed by the teſtimony of the heavenly doctrine and by the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Catholique Church, they will in no caſe be wanting to the edifying of the Church. And as much as lyeth in us, and in our government, we will do our endeavour, that the mercy of God helping us, none of thoſe duties may be pretermitted of us, whereby we hope that the true quietneſſe of the Church, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God, may be preſerved.</p>

                     <p>IN the former points we have declared, that our Preachers doe place that obedience which is given unto Magiſtrates, among good workes of the firſt degree, and that they teach, that every man ought ſo much the more diligently to apply himſelfe
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:61072:259"/> to the publique lawes, by how much he is a more ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and richer in faith.

Wherein though they were religious and wiſe, yet in this one point they offended, becauſe they were not able to diſcharge both thoſe functions ſufficiently, and it was neceſſary, that either they ſhould be wanting to the Churches in ruling them by the word, or to the commonwealth, in governing it by authoritie.</p>

Theſe things, being ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, as the ſhortnes of time would give us leave, we thought it good to offer them to your ſacred majeſtie, and that to this end, that we might both give account of our faith to thee, whom next unto God we doe chiefly honour and reverence, and might alſo ſhew how neceſſary it is, ſpeedily and earneſtly to conſult of a way and meane, whereby a thing of ſo great importance, may be knowne, diligently weighed, and diſcuſſed, as the honour which we doe chiefely owe to God (in whoſe chiefe matter it behoovethus to be converſant with feare and trembling) doth require. Secondly, it is a thing worthy of your ſacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, (which is ſo much commended for the name of religion and clemencie). To conclude, the very meane to attaine to that
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:61072:260"/> certain and ſound peace, which your ſacred Majeſtie goeth about, doth require it: which peace, ſeeing that we doe varie about Faith and Religion, can no other waies be obtained, then when as before all other things the mindes be plainly inſtructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth.</p>
                     <p>But peradventure it might ſeeme needleſſe, that we in theſe matters ſhould uſe ſo many words, ſeeing that the moſt famous Prince Elector of Saxony and others have very largely and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared unto your ſacred Majeſtie thoſe things, which at this day are in controverſie in our holy Religion. But becauſe that your ſacred Majeſtie hath deſired that all they, who have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this buſineſſe, ſhould declare unto you their judgement concerning Religion, we alſo thought it our dutie, to confeſſe thoſe things unto your ſacred Majeſtie, which are taught among us. Howbeit this matter is ſo large, and comprehendeth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, that even thoſe things which we have declared on both ſides, are as yet fewer, and more briefly declared, then that we may hope, preſently to have ſome certaintie determined in the controverſies, and that ſuch, as may be approved, not of all, but at the leaſt of a good part of Chriſtian people: So few is the number of thoſe that doe ſubſcribe to the truth. Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this matter is ſo weightie, ſo divers, and manifold, and cannot fruitfully be decided, except it be well knowne and ſifted of many, we beſeech your ſacred Majeſtie, and moſt humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt you by God and our Saviour, whoſe glory without doubt you doe chiefly ſeek, that you would procure, as ſpeedily as may be, that a generall, free, and a Chriſtian Councel in deed may be ſummoned, which hitherto hath ſeemed ſo neceſſary a thing both to your ſacred Majeſty, and alſo to other Princes of the ſacred Empire, for the ſetting of Eccleſiaſticall affaires at a ſtay, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all aſſemblies throughout the Empire, which have been gathered together ſince the beginning of this variance about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, both your ſacred Majeſties commiſſioners and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Empire, have openly witneſſed, that there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way in theſe matters, to bring that to paſſe which might be wholeſome. Whereupon in the laſt aſſembly held at Spire, your ſacred Majeſtie gave occaſion to hope, that the Biſhop of Rome would not withſtand it, but that ſuch a Councel might with ſpeed be ſummoned.</p>
                     <p>But if ſo be that in time we may not have opportunitie for a
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:61072:260"/> a generall Councell, yet at the leaſt your ſacred Majeſtie may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Provinciall aſſemblie, as they call it, of the learned men of every degree and ſtate, whereunto all, for whom it is expedient to be preſent, may freely &amp; ſafely reſort, every man may be heard, and all things may be weighed, and judged, by ſuch men, whom it is certain, as being indued with the feare of God, to make the chiefeſt account of the glory of God. For it is not unknown, how gravely, and diligently in times paſt both Emperors and Biſhops behaved themſelves in the deciding the controverſies of Faith, which notwithſtanding were oftentimes of much leſſe moment, then thoſe which doe preſently trouble Germanie, ſo that they thought it not an unworthy thing for them to examine the ſelfe ſame things the ſecond, &amp; the third time Now he that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how things ſtand at this preſent, he can not doubt, but that at this day there is greater need, then ever was heretofore, of greater faithfulneſſe, gravitie, meekneſſe, and dexteritie, to this end, that the Religion of Chriſt may be reſtored into her place. For if ſo be that we have the truth, as we doe undoubtedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, how much time and labour, I pray you, is requſite that they may know the truth, without whoſe conſent or patience at the leaſt, ſound peace cannot be obtained? But if we doe erre (from the which we doe not doubt but we be farre) againe the matter will not require ſlothfull diligence nor a ſhort time, that ſo many thouſand men may be called into the way againe. This diligence and time it ſhall not be ſo unſeemely for your Majeſtie to beſtow, as it is meet that you ſhould expreſſe his minde toward us, in whoſe ſtead you doe governe over us, to wit, the minde of Ieſus Chriſt the Saviour of us all, who, ſeeing that he came with this minde, to ſeeke, and to ſave that which was periſhed, ſo that he vouchſafed alſo to die, that he might redeeme them which were loſt, there is no cauſe, why your ſacred Majeſtie ſhould thinke much, although you ſhould undoubtedly beleeve, that we are fallen from the truth, to leave the nintie nine ſheepe in the wilderneſſe, and to ſeeke for the hundreth, and to bring it back into the ſheepfold of Chriſt, that is, to preferre this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before all other things, that the meaning of Chriſt in every of theſe things, which at this preſent are in controverſie, may out of the Scriptures be plainely and certainely laid open unto us, though we be but a few in number and of the meaner ſort, and we for our parts will ſhew our ſelves willing to be taught, (onely
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:61072:261"/> let all obſtinacie be removed) ſo that it may be lawfull to heare the voyce of our Shepheard Ieſus Chriſt: and let all things ſtay and reſt upon the Scriptures (which teach whatſoever is good) whereunto we ſhall be called. For if it ſhould ſo fall out, that the care of teaching us being rejected, there ſhould compendious formes of Edicts be ſought (which we do nothing feare whileſt the matter is in the hand of your ſacred Majeſtie) it cannot be ſaid, into what ſtraights innumerable thouſands of men ſhould be brought, to wit, of thoſe, whom, as being perſwaded that God is chiefly to be heard, and then that thoſe things which follow as opinions muſt ſtay upon the undoubted oracles of God, theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our Saviour doe alwaies appale: <hi>Feare not them which kill the bodie. He that ſhall looſe his ſoule, ſhall finde it. He that ſhall not hate father and mother, &amp;c. yea even his owne ſoule, he cannot be my Diſciple. He that ſhall be aſhamed of me, before this froward and adulterous nation, of him will I be aſhamed before my Father and his Angels.</hi> And ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Many men being moved with theſe thundering ſpeeches, have reſolved with themſelves to ſuffer all extremity: and many for feare of death doe rather ſeek delayes, but yet waiting for a fit opportunitie, if they ſhould be dealt withall in this matter by authoritie, before they be dealt withall by doctrine, and by force, before their errour ſhould be made known unto them. For of what force a ſound perſwaſion of Religion is, and how it maketh men to make no account not onely of their goods, but alſo of their lives, it hath been ſeen more then ſufficiently in very many, even within this 10. yeeres (that we may ſay nothing of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages) who have willingly ſuffered not onely baniſhments and proſcriptions, but alſo torments, and death it ſelfe, rather then they would ſuffer themſelves to be withdrawne from that judgement which they had conceived, and which they beleeved to be true. If now a dayes when as there is contention of thoſe lighter matters, there be but a few to be found, whom a man may bring to unfeigned concord, except they may bee perſwaded of the law, or the equitie of conditions, how, when as the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is of Religion, ſhall we look for true peace and, an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted tranquility in theſe matters, to wit, ſuch a one as your ſacred Majeſtie goeth about to eſtabliſh, except that on both ſides it be agreed upon, what things they be that God doth approve, and what things be agreeable to the Scriptures? For as Religion by
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:61072:261"/> right, and by the cuſtome of all nations, is preferred before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, ſo there never was any more vehement or ſharpe fight among men, then that which is undertaken for Religion. But we, ſeeing that your ſacred Majeſtie hath uſed ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable clemency toward your enemies, and thoſe ſuch, as have pretermitted no kinde of hoſtilitie, that we may let paſſe other things, have not without cauſe received great hope, that you will ſo moderate all things even in this matter alſo, that you will much more ſeeke for the praiſe of goodneſſe and courteſie in us, who are moſt deſirous of your ſafetie and honour, as we have in deed teſtified, and do from the bottome of our hearts deſire yet farther to teſtifie. For we have dealt ſo moderately in all points, that we have made it evident enough to all good men, that it was never in our minde to hurt any man, or deceitfull to increaſe our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities by the diſcommodities of other men. Indeed we have ſuſtained dangers for this cauſe, &amp; ſpent exceeding much, but we have not gained no not ſo much as a little thereby, this one thing excepted, that we being better inſtructed, touching the goodnes of God ſhewed unto us through Chriſt, we have begun (by the grace of God) to hope better of thoſe things which are to come: and of that we do by right make ſo great account, that we do not think that we either have done, or ſuffered any thing as yet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thereof, ſeeing that it is an ineſtimable thing, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred above all things, which are in heaven or in earth. We have been ſo far from emparing the riches of Eccleſiaſticall men, that when the husbandmen were in an uproar, we, to our great coſts and dangers, defended them to their uſes. The Goſpel of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as ſurely as we would that he ſhould love us, is the onely thing that enforceth us, and hath cauſed us to doe all theſe things, which we ſeeme to have altered.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let it pleaſe your ſacred Majeſtie rather to follow the examples of theſe moſt mighty and indeed happy Emperors, <hi>Conſtantine, Jovinian, Theodoſius,</hi> and ſuch like, who both by doctrine daily taught in all meekneſſe by moſt holy and vigilant Biſhops, and alſo by Councels lawfully aſſembled, and by a wiſe diſcuſſing of all things, did deal with them that erred, and aſſayed all means to bring them again into the way, before that they would determine any thing more ſharply againſt them; then to follow thoſe, who it is certain had ſuch counſellers, as were moſt unlike to thoſe ancient and holy Fathers indeed, and received an
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:61072:262"/> event nothing anſwerable to the godlineſſe of thoſe Fathers. In conſideration hereof let not your ſacred majeſtie be withdrawn with this, that the chiefeſt matters, which are now in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, were decided long ſince, and chiefly in the Councel held at Conſtance, eſpecially ſeeing you may ſee, that of thoſe innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, no leſſe holy then neceſſary decrees of the former Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, there is not ſo much as the leaſt point obſerved of our Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall men, and that they have ſo degenerated in all things, that no man which is but endued with common ſenſe, doth not cry out, that there is need of a Councel, to reſtore Religion, &amp; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the Eccleſiaſtical order. But if that doth like them ſo wel which was decreed at Conſtance, how cometh it to paſſe, that by no meanes at all that decree everſince took place, that Chriſtian Councels ſhould be aſſembled every tenth yeer? the which thing was at that time decreed. For by this mean much godlineſſe and faith might either be recovered, or preſerved.</p>
                     <p>But what is he that will not confeſſe, that ſo often as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe waxeth freſh, ſo often the remedie is to be uſed, and they which have the truth indeed doe never think it much, both that good men ſhould teach it, and alſo defend it againſt the evill ſort, where any fruit therof may be hoped for? Now when as ſo many thouſand are ſo miſerably intangled in the opinions of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who can deny that there is hope of moſt plentifull fruit, and ſuch as hath juſtly inforced all thoſe that are governed by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, that omitting all other things what ſoever, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all kind of labour and coſt, they may give themſelves wholly to this one thing, that the doctrine of Chriſt, which is the mother of all righteouſnes &amp; ſalvation, may be worthily weighed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, purged from all errors, &amp; offered in it natural colour to all thoſe that love godlines and the true worſhip of God, to the end that a peace, &amp; ſuch as may be firme for ever, &amp; a true ſetting of all holy things at a ſtay, may be reſtored &amp; confirmed to the ſheep of Chriſt, for whom he hath ſhed his blood, which are now too much troubled and wavering. The which peace can by no other meane, as we have ſaid, be reſtored and confirmed unto them, as being certain that in other things they are in ſome ſort to yeeld or to give place, but in the matter of godlines, they are ſo to ſtick, and bend themſelves to the word of God, that if they had a thouſand lives, they ſhould offer them to be tormented, rather then to yeeld one jot, or in the leaſt point, which they are perſwaded to be the
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:61072:262"/> word of God. Now if one onely ſoule be of more value then the whole world, what ought we to doe for the ſalvation of many thouſands? Certainly ſeeing we are allured by ſo great a hope, both by this, that they which are accuſed to your ſacred Majeſtie of errour, doe deſire nothing elſe but that they may be taught, and have wholly addicted themſelves to the holy Scriptures, which are fully ſufficient to confute every errour: and alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that Chriſt our Saviour hath made ſo large a promiſe, <hi>that where even two or three be gathered together in his name, there he will be in the middeſt of them, and grant unto them any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſhall agree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things, moſt godly Emperour, we doe here rehearſe for no other cauſe, then to ſhew our ſelves obedient to your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſtie, which would have us alſo to declare what is our judgement, concerning the reforming of Religion. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we have good hope that your ſacred Majeſtie hath of late very well conſidered, and doth ſufficiently perceive, what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie doth enforce us thereunto, what fruit doth allure us, and to conclude, how worthy a thing this is for your ſacred Majeſty, which is ſo much praiſed for Religion and clemencie, that all the beſt learned and moſt godly men being called together, they may finde out of the divine Scriptures, what is to be thought of every point of doctrine, which are at this time in controverſie, and then that it be expounded by the fit Miniſters of Chriſt, with all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and faithfulneſſe, to them which are thought to be detained in errours. Notwithſtanding herewithall it is to be feared, that there will not be men wanting, who will doe their endeavour to withdraw your ſacred Majeſtie from this: unto theſe men it ſeemed good to us in this ſort to make anſwer as it were before your Majeſtie. Let it pleaſe your ſacred Majeſtie, according to your moſt excellent clemencie, for which you are renowned, to take and interpret in good part, both this ſame, and all other things, (which we have here expounded and confeſſed, for no other reſpect, then to defend the glory of Chriſt Ieſus our God, as our dutie requireth, and, as it is meet we ſhould, to obey your ſacred Majeſtie) and to account us among thoſe, who truely doe from our hearts deſire to ſhew our ſelves no leſſe obedient and addicted to your Majeſtie in all humble ſubjection, then were our blders, being ready in this point, ſo farre as is lawfull, to ſpend both our goods and our lives. The King of glory Ieſus Chriſt
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:61072:263"/> grant unto your ſacred Majeſtie, both in this and in all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to doe all things to his glory, and preſerve it long, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it happily both in health, and in flouriſhing eſtate, to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie of all Chriſtendome. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Firſt, that in the judging of controverſies, not any judges whatſoever doe take unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the name of the Church: but that as the matter and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the cauſe doth require, judges lawfully choſen, whether more or fewer, whether in an ordinary aſſembly of a particular Church, or in a more generall meeting, ordinary or extraordinary, provinciall or generall, be appointed to judge of the matter. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that there be free obedience, and free giving of voyces.
<pb facs="tcp:61072:271"/> Thirdly, that all controverſies be determined out of the word of God alone, yet ſo as the fathers judgements be not condemned, but laid to the onely rule of Gods word (according as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would have us to doe.) Now the Church is ſaid to judge of doctrine, not that it is above the truth of the doctrine, or that the doctrine is therefore true, becauſe the Church hath ſo judged, but in as much as the Church being taught and confirmed out of the word by the holy Ghoſt, doth acknowledge and hold faſt the true doctrine and teach men to hold it faſt, and condemneth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth, and teacheth to reject all other ſtrange doctrines.</p>

                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We alſo doe allow of this, namely that the word of God is not deceitfull, and therefore as often as the holy ſignes are rightly given, that is, according to Chriſt his inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that then alſo the thing ſignified by the ſigne (which is the very body of Chriſt crucified for us, and the very bloud of Chriſt ſhed for us) is alſo given to be received. But we affirme that the thing ſignified is no otherwiſe coupled with the ſigne, then ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally. The truth of which ſacramentall conjunction, doth not conſiſt in this, that whereſoever the ſigne is, there the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the ſigne, ſhould alſo be preſent, but in this, that that which God promiſeth by the ſigne, he alſo doth offer to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Therefore we hold that the body of Chriſt is not really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in, with, or under the bread, otherwiſe then after this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall manner, both becauſe it is a true body, being circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in his locall ſituation, and alſo hath truly aſcended from the earth, above the heavens, that be ſubject to our ſight, and ſhall there remaine (from whence he exerciſeth a government over all theſe beneath, even as he is man) untill he come truly from thence to judge both quick and dead. Moreover we doe alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch that as the ſignes are offered to the body, ſo the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified are offered to the minde: and therefore that the ſignes are received of every one with the hand and mouth, that come unto the ſupper: the which unto ſome, namely, to the worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, doe turne unto ſalvation, but unto others, that is, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy communicants by reaſon of the prophanation of the ſignes, and contempt of the thing ſignified, they doe turne to condemnation. As for the things ſignified thoſe we affirme to be
<pb facs="tcp:61072:276"/> truly, and effectually apprehended, onely of thoſe that be indued with a right minde and a true faith, and that alwaies unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereunto the diſtance of place is no hinderance by reaſon of the unſpeakable operation of the holy Ghoſt. And yet not ſo as that the ſubſtances ſhould be mingled betwixt themſelves, or cleave together in any place (for Chriſts fleſh abideth in heaven, and ours upon the earth) but that (theſe things being myſtically united, which in true diſtance of ſituation are ſeparated) we might draw from the fleſh of Chriſt all gifts neceſſary for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and eſpecially that lively juyce whereby we are nouriſhed to eternall life. Therefore whatſoever they pretend which are of the contrary judgement, the controverſie is not either of the ſigne, or of the things ſignified, or of the truth of the Sacraments, or of the receiving of them, or of the effects; but of the onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the ſacramentall conjunction, and alſo of the manner of receiving the things ſignified. Both which we contend to be ſo interpreted by ſome out of the word of God, that if their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be once granted, both the truth of Chriſts body, his aſſention into heaven, and his ſecond coming is conſequently overthrown. Looke the expoſition of this Article expreſſed in the divers edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Auſpurge</hi> Confeſſion, though not after the ſame manner, and in the ſame words, and for the full declaration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of looke in the Admonition lately ſet forth by our brethren the <hi>Neuſtadians</hi> in the 5.

<pb facs="tcp:61072:277"/> there, we think that it is moſt rightly celebrated, where it is moſt ſimply and moſt neerly unto the firſt inſtitution obſerved.

Epheſ. 2.</note> free will, but the ſpirit of our Lord Ieſus, who dwelling in our hearts by true faith, bringeth forth ſuch good workes, as God hath prepared for us to walke in. For this we moſt boldly affirme, that it is blaſphemie, to ſay, that Chriſt abideth in the hearts of ſuch, as in whom there is no ſpirit of ſanctification. And therefore we feare not to affirme, that murderers, oppreſſors, cruell perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, adulterers, whoremongers, filthy perſons, Idolaters, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, theeves, and all workers of iniquitie, have neither true faith, neither any portion of the ſpirit of the Lord Ieſus, ſo long as obſtinately they continue in their wickedneſſe. For how ſoone that ever the ſpirit of the Lord Ieſus (which Gods elect children receive by true faith) taketh poſſeſſion in the heart of every man, ſo ſoone doth he regenerate and renue the ſame man, ſo that he beginneth to hate that which before he loved, and beginneth to love that, which before he hated. And from thence cometh that continuall battell which is betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61072:288"/> Gods children: ſo that the fleſh and naturall man, according to<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> the owne corruption, luſteth for things pleaſing, and delectable unto it ſelfe, grudgeth in adverſitie, is lifted up in proſperitie, and at every moment is prone and ready to offend the Majeſty of God. But the Spirit of God which giveth witneſſing to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Rom 3.</note> that we are the ſonnes of God, maketh us to reſiſt filthy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to grone in Gods preſence for deliverance from this bondage of corruption. And finally, ſo triumpheth over ſinne, that it reigneth not in our mortall bodies. This battell have not the carnall men, being deſtitute of Gods Spirit, but doe follow and obey ſinne with greedineſſe, and without repentance, even as the Devill and their corrupt luſts doe pricke them. But the ſonnes of God, as before is ſaid, doe fight againſt ſinne, doe ſob and mourn, when they perceive themſelves tempted in iniquitie: and if they fall they riſe againe with unfained repentance, and theſe things they doe, not by their owne power, but by the power of the Lord Ieſus, without whom they were able to doe nothing.<note place="margin">Iohn 15.</note>

Not that we imagine any tranſubſtantiation of the bread in Chriſts naturall body, and of wine in his naturall blood, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have perniciouſly taught, and damnably beleeved: but this union and conjunction, which we have with the body and blood of Chriſt Ieſus in the right uſe of the Sacrament, is wrought by the operation of the holy Ghoſt, who by true faith carrieth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things that are viſible, carnall, and earthly and maketh us to feed upon the body and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, which was once broken and ſhed for us, which now is in heaven, and appeareth in the preſence of his Father for us: and notwithſtanding the farre diſtance of place, which is betwixt his body now glorified in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and us now mortall in this earth, yet we muſt aſſuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that the bread which we breake is the communion of Chriſts body, and the cup which we bleſſe, is the communion of his blood, ſo that we confeſſe and undoubtedly beleeve, that the faithfull in the right uſe of the Lords Table, doe ſo eate the body and drink the blood of the Lord Ieſus, that he remaineth in them, and they in him. Yea they are ſo made fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones, that as the eternall Godhead giveth to the fleſh of Chriſt Ieſus (which of the owne condition and nature was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and corruptible) life and immortalitie, ſo doth Chriſt Ieſus his fleſh and blood eaten and drunken by us, give unto vs the ſame prerogatives. Which albeit we confeſſe are neither given unto us at this time onely, neither yet by the proper power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sacrament onely, yet we affirme, that the faithfull, in the right uſe of the Lords Table, have ſuch conjunction with Chriſt Ieſus, as the naturall man cannot apprehend: yea, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we affirme, that albeit the faithfull oppreſſed by negligence, and manly infirmitie, doe not profit ſo much as they would, in the very inſtant action of the Supper, yet ſhall it after bring fruit forth, as lively ſeed ſowne in good ground. For the holy ſpirit, which can never be divided from the right inſtitution of the Lord Ieſus, will not fruſtrate the faithfull of the fruit of that myſticall action: but all this we ſay cometh of true faith which apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Chriſt Ieſus, who onely maketh his Sacraments effectuall unto us. And therefore whoſoever ſlandereth us, as that we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme or beleeve Sacraments to be onely naked and bare ſignes,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61072:292"/> doth injury unto us, and ſpeaketh againſt the manifeſt truth. But this liberally and frankly we confeſſe, that we make diſtinction betwixt Chriſt Ieſus, in his eternall ſubſtance, and betwixt the elements, in the ſacramentall ſignes. So that we wil neither worſhip the ſignes, in place of that which is ſignified by them, neither yet doe we deſpiſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them as unprofitable, and vaine, but do uſe them with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, examining our ſelves diligently before that ſo we doe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are aſſured by the mouth of the Apoſtle, that ſuch as eate of that bread, and drink of that cup unworthily, are guilty of the body and of the blood of Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

                  <head>Of the right adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</head>
                  <p>THat Sacraments be rightly miniſtred, we judge two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite: the one, that they be miniſtred by lawfull miniſters, whom we affirme to be onely they, that are appointed to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, into whoſe mouthes, God hath put ſome Sermon of exhortation, they being men lawfully choſen thereto by ſome Church. The other that they be miniſtred in ſuch elements, and in ſuch ſort, as God hath appointed: elſe we affirme that they ceaſe to be right Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Chriſt Ieſus. And therefore it is that we flie the ſocietie with the papiſticall Church, in participation of their Sacraments, firſt, becauſe their Miniſters are no Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus (yea, this is more horrible, they ſuffer women, whom the holy Ghoſt will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to teach in the Congregation, to baptize:) and ſecondly, becauſe they have ſo adulterated both the one Sacrament and the other, with their owne inventions, that no part of Chriſts action abideth in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall puritie. For oyle, ſait, ſpattle, and ſuch like in baptiſme, are but mens inventions: adoration, veneration, bearing through ſtreets and townes, and keeping of bread in boxes or boiſts, are prophanation of Chriſts Sacraments, and no uſe of the ſame. For Chriſt ſeſus ſaid, <hi>Take eat, &amp;c. Do you this in remembrance of me.</hi> By which words &amp; charge, he ſanctified bread and wine to be the Sacrment of his holy body and blood, to the end that the one ſhould be eaten, and that all ſhould drink of the other, and not that they ſhould be kept, to be worſhipped and honoured as God, as the Papiſts have done heretofore: who alſo have committed ſacriledge, ſtealing from the people the one part of the Sacrament, to wit, the bleſſed cup. Moreover that the Sacraments be rightly uſed, it is required, that the end and cauſe for which Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were inſtituted, be underſtanded, and obſerved, as well of the Miniſter, as by the receivers. For if the opinion be changed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61072:293"/> the right uſe ceaſeth, which is moſt evident, by the rejection of the ſacrifices: as alſo if the teacher plainly teach falſe doctrine, which were odious and abominable before God (albeit they were his owne ordinance) becauſe the wicked men uſe them to another end, then God hath ordained. The ſame we affirme of the Sacraments in the Papiſticall Church, in which we affirme the whole action of the Lord Ieſus to be adultered, as well in the external forme, as in the end and opinion. What Chriſt Ieſus did, and commanded to be done, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, by the Evangeliſts and by Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> what the Prieſt doth at his Altar, we need not to rehearſe. The end and cauſe of Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and why the ſelfe ſame ſhould be uſed, is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>Doe ye this in remembrance of me. As oft as ye ſhall eate this bread, and drinke of this cup, you ſhall ſhew forth,</hi> that is, extoll, preach, magnifie, and praiſe <hi>the Lords death till he come.</hi> But to what end and in what opinion the Prieſts ſay their Maſſe, let the words of the their own Doctors and writings witneſſe: to wit, that they, as Mediatours betwixt Chriſt and his Church, doe offer unto God the Father, a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice propitiatory for the ſinnes of the quick and the dead: which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is blaſphemous to Chriſt Ieſus, and making derogation to the ſufficiencie of his onely ſacrifice, once offered for purgation of all thoſe that ſhall be ſanctified, we utterly abhorte, deteſt, and renounce.</p>

We farther confeſſe and acknowledge, that ſuch perſons as are placed in authoritie, are to be beloved, honoured, feared, and holden in moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent eſtimation: becauſe they are the Lievetenants of God, in whoſe ſeats God himſelfe doth ſit and Iudge, yea, even the Iudges and Princes themſelves, to whom by God is given the ſword, to the praiſe and defence of good men, and to revenge and puniſh all male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours. Moreover, to Kings, Princes, Rulers, and Magiſtrates, we affirme that chiefly and moſt principally, the conſervation and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Religion appertaineth, ſo that not onely they are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for civill pollicie, but alſo for maintenance of the true Religion, and for ſuppreſſing of idolatry and ſuperſtition whatſoever.

                  <p>ALbeit that the word of God truly preached, and the Sacraments rightly miniſtred, and diſcipline executed according to the word of God, be the certaine and infallible ſignes of the true Church, yet we meane not that every particular perſon joyned with ſuch company, is an elect member of Chriſt Ieſus.

In ſo much that albeit ſin remaine and continually abide in theſe our mortall bodies, yet it is not imputed unto us, but is remitted and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Chriſts juſtice. Secondly, in the generall judgement, there ſhall be given to every man and woman, reſurrection of the fleſh. For the ſea ſhall give her dead: the earth thoſe that therein be incloſed, yea the eternall God ſhall ſtretch out his hand on the duſt, and the dead ſhall ariſe uncorruptible, and that in the ſubſtance of the ſame fleſh that every man now beareth, to receive according to their works, glory, or puniſhment. For ſuch as now delight in vanitie, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, filthineſſe, ſuperſtition, or idolatry, ſhall be adjudged to the fire unquenchable: in which they ſhall be tormented for ever, as well in their own bodies, as in their ſouls, which now they give to ſerve the devill in all abhomination.
